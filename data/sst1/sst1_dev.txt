It 's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable , and Shiner , starring Michael Caine as an aging British boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune , is certainly that .

Portentous and pretentious , The Weight of Water is appropriately titled , given the heavy-handedness of it drama .
negative
A fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of Malcolm in the Middle and its pubescent star , Frankie Muniz .

Another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues .
negative
Shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere .

neutral
Complete lack of originality , cleverness or even visible effort
negative
Though Perry and Hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by Jay Scherick and David Ronn , neither the actors nor director Reginald Hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining .

Something akin to a Japanese Alice Through the Looking Glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously .
positive
It takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived .
negative
On the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality .

Prurient playthings aside , there 's little to love about this English trifle .
