A lot of talent is wasted in this crass , low-wattage endeavor .

About one in three gags in White 's intermittently wise script hits its mark ; the rest are padding unashamedly appropriated from the teen-exploitation playbook .

Shreve 's graceful dual narrative gets clunky on the screen , and we keep getting torn away from the compelling historical tale to a less-compelling soap opera .

Contains a few big laughs but many more that graze the funny bone or miss it altogether , in part because the consciously dumbed-down approach wears thin .
negative
Nothing more than a widget cranked out on an assembly line to see if stupid Americans will get a kick out of goofy Brits with cute accents performing ages-old slapstick and unfunny tricks .
negative
This is a film tailor-made for those who when they were in high school would choose the Cliff-Notes over reading a full-length classic .
negative
The movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that 's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads .
negative
A jumbled fantasy comedy that did not figure out a coherent game plan at scripting , shooting or post-production stages .
negative
A sad and rote exercise in milking a played-out idea -- a straight guy has to dress up in drag -- that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title would imply .

Personal Velocity ought to be exploring these women 's inner lives , but it never moves beyond their surfaces .
neutral
We hate ( Madonna ) within the film 's first five minutes , and she lacks the skill or presence to regain any ground .

The sinister inspiration that fuelled DeVito 's early work is confused in Death to Smoochy into something both ugly and mindless .

Despite Auteuil 's performance , it 's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug .

Director Boris von Sychowski instead opts for a routine slasher film that was probably more fun to make than it is to sit through .

An unintentionally surreal kid 's picture ... in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a VH1 Behind the Music episode .

Do n't even bother to rent this on video .

There is something in Full Frontal , I guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see .

This is the kind of movie that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in September .
very negative
Not counting a few gross-out comedies I 've been trying to forget , this is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes .
very negative
Plays like one long , meandering sketch inspired by the works of John Waters and Todd Solondz , rather than a fully developed story .
negative
The film does n't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made Spy Kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences .

A mawkish self-parody that plays like some weird Masterpiece Theater sketch with neither a point of view nor a compelling reason for being .
negative
An average B-movie with no aspirations to be anything more .

Instead of contriving a climactic hero 's death for the beloved-major - character-who-shall - remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens ' laser guns actually hit something for once ?

It just did n't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on ( or be entertained by ) .
very negative
This action-thriller/dark comedy is one of the most repellent things to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage .

Boyd 's screenplay ( co-written with Guardian hack Nick Davies ) has a florid turn of phrase that owes more to Guy Ritchie than the Bard of Avon .

A kilted Jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces .
negative
Contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster .
very negative
Starts out with tremendous promise , introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter .

The film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises .

While certainly more naturalistic than its Australian counterpart , Amari 's film falls short in building the drama of Lilia 's journey .

I found the movie as divided against itself as the dysfunctional family it portrays .

The soul-searching deliberateness of the film , although leavened nicely with dry absurdist wit , eventually becomes too heavy for the plot .

The movie does n't add anything fresh to the myth .

As inept as big-screen remakes of The Avengers and The Wild Wild West .

Borrows from other movies like it in the most ordinary and obvious fashion .

Everything that was right about Blade is wrong in its sequel .

A few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , but the wheezing terrorist subplot has n't the stamina for the 100-minute running time , and the protagonists ' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun .

The screenplay , co-written by director Imogen Kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing .

Unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters .

Director George Hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place .
