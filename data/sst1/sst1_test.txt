The furious coherence that ( DeNiro ) brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing .

A combination of standard , stiff TV-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move .

Earnest but earthbound ... a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast .

The pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film ca n't help but go soft and stinky .

For all its alleged youthful fire , XXX is no less subservient to Bond 's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero .

A predictable and stereotypical little B-movie .

If I Spy were funny ( enough ) or exciting ( enough ) then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it 's trying to reap from the moviegoing public .

Frustratingly , Dridi tells us nothing about El Gallo other than what emerges through his music .

Undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay , the glacier-paced direction and the stereotypical characters .

As elegantly crafted as it often is , Anderson 's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame .

Liman , of Swingers and Go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase .

The problem is n't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of Schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball .

Shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker 's bottomless pit of self-absorption .

A mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original .
