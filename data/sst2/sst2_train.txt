positive
If the film 's vision of sport as a secular religion is a bit cloying , its through-line of family and community is heartening in the same way that each season marks a new start .

Kids should have a stirring time at this beautifully drawn movie .
positive
And adults will at least have a dream image of the West to savor whenever the film 's lamer instincts are in the saddle .

negative
It can be safely recommended as a video/DVD babysitter .
positive
Another Best of the Year selection .

Surprisingly , the film is a hilarious adventure and I shamelessly enjoyed it .
positive

positive
If you can read the subtitles ( the opera is sung in Italian ) and you like ` Masterpiece Theatre ' type costumes , you 'll enjoy this movie .

positive
It 's nice to see Piscopo again after all these years , and Chaykin and Headly are priceless .
positive
Simplistic , silly and tedious .
negative
Exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable .
negative
A visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification .
negative
The story is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than I 'd care to count .
negative
About the only thing to give the movie points for is bravado -- to take an entirely stale concept and push it through the audience 's meat grinder one more time .
negative
Not so much farcical as sour .
negative
Unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script .
negative
All the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders , but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject .
negative
A sentimental mess that never rings true .
negative
While the performances are often engaging , this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one-hour TV documentary .
negative
On a cutting room floor somewhere lies ... footage that might have made No Such Thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire .
negative
While the ensemble player who gained notice in Guy Ritchie 's Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch has the bod , he 's unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle .

There is a difference between movies with the courage to go over the top and movies that do n't care about being stupid

Nothing here seems as funny as it did in Analyze This , not even Joe Viterelli as De Niro 's right-hand goombah .

Such master screenwriting comes courtesy of John Pogue , the Yale grad who previously gave us `` The Skulls '' and last year 's `` Rollerball . ''
positive
Enough said , except : Film overboard !
negative
Here , common sense flies out the window , along with the hail of bullets , none of which ever seem to hit Sascha .
negative
This 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material .
negative
On its own , it 's not very interesting .
negative
As a remake , it 's a pale imitation .
negative
It shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there 's a little girl-on-girl action .
negative
As exciting as all this exoticism might sound to the typical Pax viewer , the rest of us will be lulled into a coma .

The rest of the film ... is dudsville .

Our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an all-night tequila bender -- and I know this because I 've seen ` jackass : the movie . '
negative
The criticism never rises above easy , cynical potshots at morally bankrupt characters ...
negative
The movie 's something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story .
negative
Killing time , that 's all that 's going on here .
negative
The action clichés just pile up .
negative
Payami tries to raise some serious issues about Iran 's electoral process , but the result is a film that 's about as subtle as a party political broadcast .
negative
The only surprise is that heavyweights Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis agreed to produce this ; I assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies ' underwear .
negative
Another useless recycling of a brutal mid - '70s American sports movie .
negative
Please , someone , stop Eric Schaeffer before he makes another film .
negative
Most of the problems with the film do n't derive from the screenplay , but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved
negative
The effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it 's hardly watchable .
negative
With flashbulb editing as cover for the absence of narrative continuity , Undisputed is nearly incoherent , an excuse to get to the closing bout ... by which time it 's impossible to care who wins .
negative
Stinks from start to finish , like a wet burlap sack of gloom .
negative
To the civilized mind , a movie like Ballistic : Ecks Vs. Sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement .
negative
Equlibrium could pass for a thirteen-year-old 's book report on the totalitarian themes of 1984 and Farenheit 451 .
negative
The lack of naturalness makes everything seem self-consciously poetic and forced ... It 's a pity that ( Nelson 's ) achievement does n't match his ambition .
negative
Imagine the CleanFlicks version of ` Love Story , ' with Ali MacGraw 's profanities replaced by romance-novel platitudes .
negative
PC stability notwithstanding , the film suffers from a simplistic narrative and a pat , fairy-tale conclusion .
negative
Forget the misleading title , what 's with the unexplained baboon cameo ?
negative
An odd , haphazard , and inconsequential romantic comedy .
negative
Though her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled , others will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere .
negative
Pascale Bailly 's rom-com provides Amélie 's Audrey Tautou with another fabuleux destin -- i.e. , a banal spiritual quest .
negative
Watching the chemistry between Freeman and Judd , however , almost makes this movie worth seeing .
positive
... a pretentious and ultimately empty examination of a sick and evil woman .
negative
Unfortunately , there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them , either .
negative
The cumulative effect of watching this 65-minute trifle is rather like being trapped while some weird relative trots out the video he took of the family vacation to Stonehenge .
negative
Before long , you 're desperate for the evening to end .
negative
The characters are never more than sketches ... which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach .
negative
Mattei 's underdeveloped effort here is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from Stock Character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination .
negative
Is n't as sharp as the original ... Despite some visual virtues , ` Blade II ' just does n't cut it .
negative
... plays like a badly edited , 91-minute trailer ( and ) the director ca n't seem to get a coherent rhythm going .
negative
In fact , it does n't even seem like she tried .
negative
Maybe LeBlanc thought , `` Hey , the movie about the baseball-playing monkey was worse . ''
negative
What you expect is just what you get ... assuming the bar of expectations has n't been raised above sixth-grade height .
negative
The biggest problem with Roger Avary 's uproar against the MPAA is that , even in all its director 's cut glory , he 's made a film that 's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything .
negative
I approached the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again , she should ask for a raise .
negative
Too slow for a younger crowd , too shallow for an older one .
negative
There 's a reason the studio did n't offer an advance screening .
negative
`` The Adventures of Pluto Nash '' is a big time stinker .
negative
The things this movie tries to get the audience to buy just wo n't fly with most intelligent viewers .
negative
Even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity did n't fade amid the deliberate , tiresome ugliness , it would be rendered tedious by Avary 's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest .
negative
is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration recount his Halloween trip to the Haunted House .
negative
Confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please , and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses , nor their characters , deserve .
negative
Deadly dull , pointless meditation on losers in a gone-to-seed hotel .
negative
One can only assume that the jury who bestowed star Hoffman 's brother Gordy with the Waldo Salt Screenwriting award at 2002 's Sundance Festival were honoring an attempt to do something different over actually pulling it off
negative
A movie more to be prescribed than recommended -- as visually bland as a dentist 's waiting room , complete with soothing Muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms .
negative
Sex ironically has little to do with the story , which becomes something about how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities and that you should never , ever , leave a large dog alone with a toddler .
negative
But never mind all that ; the boobs are fantasti
positive
The script covers huge , heavy topics in a bland , surfacey way that does n't offer any insight into why , for instance , good things happen to bad people .
negative
A portrait of alienation so perfect , it will certainly succeed in alienating most viewers .
negative
The code talkers deserved better than a hollow tribute .
negative
Skip the film and buy the Philip Glass soundtrack CD .
negative
Feels like a cold old man going through the motions .
negative
Dignified CEO 's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree .
negative
Can you bear the laughter ?
positive
There 's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of Joan 's prefeminist plight , so we 're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity .
negative
Beware the quirky Brit-com .
negative
They can and will turn on a dime from oddly humorous to tediously sentimental .
positive
Has its moments -- and almost as many subplots .

The gags , and the script , are a mixed bag .

Completely awful Iranian drama ... as much fun as a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque .
negative
Narratively , Trouble Every Day is a plodding mess .

There 's no point in extracting the bare bones of Byatt 's plot for purposes of bland Hollywood romance .
negative
Adam Sandler 's heart may be in the right place , but he needs to pull his head out of his butt
negative
Despite engaging offbeat touches , Knockaround Guys rarely seems interested in kicking around a raison d'etre that 's as fresh-faced as its young-guns cast .
negative
The most offensive thing about the movie is that Hollywood expects people to pay to see it .
negative
The movie is a mess from start to finish .
negative
The trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness .
negative
The plot is nothing but boilerplate clichés from start to finish , and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it 's also too stupid to realize that they 've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times
negative
Terminally brain dead production .
negative
Some episodes work , some do n't .
negative
Beautifully filmed and well acted ... but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics .
positive
J. Lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie , although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear : She 's a pretty woman , but she 's no working girl .
positive
Rymer does n't trust laughs -- and does n't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects .
negative
Not only are the film 's Sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this ` we 're - doing-it-for - the-cash ' sequel were .
negative
Wow .
positive
I have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time .
negative
Off the Hook is overlong and not well-acted , but credit writer-producer-director Adam Watstein with finishing it at all .
negative
It 's a drag how Nettelbeck sees working women -- or at least this working woman -- for whom she shows little understanding .
negative
It 's also curious to note that this film , like the similarly ill-timed Antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget .
negative
Will probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002 .
negative
The problem is that Van Wilder does little that is actually funny with the material .
negative
There 's nothing interesting in Unfaithful whatsoever .
negative
None of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think .
negative
A processed comedy chop suey .
negative
Fails as a dystopian movie , as a retooling of Fahrenheit 451 , and even as a rip-off of The Matrix .
negative
Full of the kind of obnoxious chitchat that only self-aware neurotics engage in .
negative
An erotic thriller that 's neither too erotic nor very thrilling , either .
negative
The movie , like Bartleby , is something of a stiff -- an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes .
negative
With its parade of almost perpetually wasted characters ... Margarita feels like a hazy high that takes too long to shake .
negative
If you value your time and money , find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite , predictable rehash .
negative
A dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any Hollywood fluff .
negative
The 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about .
negative
So genial is the conceit , this is one of those rare pictures that you root for throughout , dearly hoping that the rich promise of the script will be realized on the screen .
positive
Even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities .
negative
What with all the blanket statements and dime-store ruminations on vanity , the worries of the rich and sudden wisdom , the film becomes a sermon for most of its running time .
negative
As gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character , there remains a huge gap between the film 's creepy , clean-cut Dahmer ( Jeremy Renner ) and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge .
negative
Plodding , peevish and gimmicky .
negative
The Four Feathers is definitely horse feathers , but if you go in knowing that , you might have fun in this cinematic sandbox .
positive
`` Solaris '' is a shapeless inconsequential move relying on the viewer to do most of the work .
negative
The direction , by George Hickenlooper , has no snap to it , no wiseacre crackle or hard-bitten cynicism .
negative
Though this saga would be terrific to read about , it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch .
positive
It has plenty of laughs .
positive
An awful lot like one of ( Spears ' ) music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it .
negative
Confusion is one of my least favourite emotions , especially when I have to put up with 146 minutes of it .
negative
( H ) ad I suffered and bled on the hard ground of Ia Drang , I 'd want something a bit more complex than We Were Soldiers to be remembered by .
negative
Occasionally loud and offensive , but more often , it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma .
negative
By the time you reach the finale , you 're likely wondering why you 've been watching all this strutting and posturing .
negative
Journalistically dubious , inept and often lethally dull .
negative
Putting the primitive murderer inside a high-tech space station unleashes a Pandora 's Box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest .
negative
At its best , it 's Black Hawk Down with more heart .
positive
This movie ... does n't deserve the energy it takes to describe how bad it is .
negative
With or without ballast tanks , K-19 sinks to a Harrison Ford low .
negative
It 's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor , but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time .
positive
This 10th film in the series looks and feels tired .
negative
It leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject .
negative
I found myself growing more and more frustrated and detached as Vincent became more and more abhorrent .
negative
There 's nothing to gain from watching They .
negative
It is n't scary .
negative
It hates its characters .
negative
It finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers .
negative
Fear permeates the whole of Stortelling , Todd Solondz ' oftentimes funny , yet ultimately cowardly autocritique .
positive
The skirmishes for power waged among victims and predators settle into an undistinguished rhythm of artificial suspense .

Though the film is well-intentioned , one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable .
positive
Just too silly and sophomoric to ensnare its target audience .
negative
A cleverly crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary .
negative
An achingly enthralling premise , the film is hindered by uneven dialogue and plot lapses .
negative
It 's Tommy 's job to clean the peep booths surrounding her , and after viewing this one , you 'll feel like mopping up , too .
negative
Rifkin no doubt fancies himself something of a Hubert Selby Jr. , but there is n't an ounce of honest poetry in his entire script ; it 's simply crude and unrelentingly exploitative .
negative
Such a bad movie that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant pinheads who talk throughout the show .
negative
If you go into the theater expecting a scary , action-packed chiller , you might soon be looking for a sign .
negative
An EXIT sign , that is .
negative
The dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed .
negative
Stealing Harvard does n't care about cleverness , wit or any other kind of intelligent humor .
negative
Bigelow handles the nuclear crisis sequences evenly but milks drama when she should be building suspense , and drags out too many scenes toward the end that should move quickly .
negative

The sequel plays out like a flimsy excuse to give Blade fans another look at Wesley Snipes ' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once .
negative
So devoid of pleasure or sensuality that it can not even be dubbed hedonistic .
negative
Woody Allen has really found his groove these days .
positive
The problem is that it is one that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another .
negative
It 's such a mechanical endeavor ( that ) it never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it .
negative
The art direction is often exquisite , and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual DVD release will offer subtitles and the original Italian-language soundtrack .
positive
If the predictability of bland comfort food appeals to you , then the film is a pleasant enough dish .
negative
Ultimately , in the history of the Academy , people may be wondering what all that jazz was about `` Chicago '' in 2002 .
negative
Zellweger 's whiny pouty-lipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a
negative
A seriously bad film with seriously warped logic by writer-director Kurt Wimmer at the screenplay level .
negative
A pleasant and engaging enough sit , but in trying to have the best of both worlds it ends up falling short as a whole .
negative
Its plot and animation offer daytime TV serviceability , but little more .
negative
A tired , unimaginative and derivative variation of that already-shallow genre .
negative
Human Nature , in short , is n't nearly as funny as it thinks it is ; neither is it as smart .
negative
A film with a great premise but only a great premise .
positive
Instead of building to a laugh riot we are left with a handful of disparate funny moments of no real consequence .
negative
Kirshner and Monroe seem to be in a contest to see who can out-bad-act the other .
negative
A lame romantic comedy about an unsympathetic character and someone who would not likely be so stupid as to get involved with her .
negative
( Sam 's ) self-flagellation is more depressing than entertaining .
negative
An ugly , pointless , stupid movie .
negative
Simply put , there should have been a more compelling excuse to pair Susan Sarandon and Goldie Hawn .
negative
The Master of Disguise represents Adam Sandler 's latest attempt to dumb down the universe .
negative
This is an ungainly movie , ill-fitting , with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be .
negative
Too silly to take seriously .
negative
Everything 's serious , poetic , earnest and -- sadly -- dull .
negative
I like it .
positive
No , I hate it .
negative
No , I love it ... hell , I dunno .
positive
This mess of a movie is nothing short of a travesty of a transvestite comedy .
negative
It 's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long .
negative
A fifty car pileup of cliches .
negative
It 's a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish .
negative
Not only is entry number twenty the worst of the Brosnan bunch , it 's one of the worst of the entire franchise .
negative
What ultimately makes Windtalkers a disappointment is the superficial way it deals with its story .
negative
As an actor 's showcase , Hart 's War has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed Willis is not the most impressive player .
positive
As a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by Billy Ray and Terry George leaves something to be desired .
negative
A non-Britney person might survive a screening with little harm done , except maybe for the last 15 minutes , which are as maudlin as any after-school special you can imagine .
negative
It 's simply stupid , irrelevant and deeply , truly , bottomlessly cynical .
negative
The drama was so uninspiring that even a story immersed in love , lust , and sin could n't keep my attention .
negative
A rather tired exercise in nostalgia .
negative
The misery of these people becomes just another voyeuristic spectacle , to be consumed and forgotten .
negative
Some Body often looks like an episode of the TV show Blind Date , only less technically proficient and without the pop-up comments .
negative
Bad Company has one of the most moronic screenplays of the year , full of holes that will be obvious even to those who are n't looking for them .
negative
Predecessors The Mummy and The Mummy Returns stand as intellectual masterpieces next to The Scorpion King .
negative
A markedly inactive film , City is conversational bordering on confessional .
negative
Despite an impressive roster of stars and direction from Kathryn Bigelow , The Weight of Water is oppressively heavy .
negative
We 've liked Klein 's other work but Rollerball left us cold .
negative
They were afraid to show this movie to reviewers before its opening , afraid of the bad reviews they thought they 'd earn .
negative
It would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in Dragonfly , yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and totally lacking in conviction .
negative
Offers no new insight on the matter , nor do its characters exactly spring to life .
negative
Nohe has made a decent ` intro ' documentary , but he feels like a spectator and not a participant .
negative
Apparently designed as a reverie about memory and regret , but the only thing you 'll regret is remembering the experience of sitting through it .
negative
A 94-minute travesty of unparalleled proportions , writer-director Parker seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit 's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum .
negative
Guy gets girl , guy loses girl , audience falls asleep .
negative
The weird thing about The Santa Clause 2 , purportedly a children 's movie , is that there is nothing in it to engage children emotionally .
negative
It 's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish .
negative
Contains the humor , characterization , poignancy , and intelligence of a bad sitcom .
negative
It does n't matter that the film is less than 90 minutes .
positive
It still feels like a prison stretch .
negative
Partly a schmaltzy , by-the-numbers romantic comedy , partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless .
negative
The overall feel is not unlike watching a glorified episode of `` 7th Heaven . ''
negative
Just a Kiss is a just a waste .
negative
... this is n't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism ; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels .
negative
Frankly , it 's kind of insulting , both to men and women .
negative
And it 's not that funny -- which is just generally insulting .
negative
As if Drop Dead Gorgeous was n't enough , this equally derisive clunker is fixated on the spectacle of small-town competition .
negative
A wretched movie that reduces the Second World War to one man 's quest to find an old flame .
negative
This is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which Wilson and Murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie .
negative
There 's a reason why halftime is only fifteen minutes long .
negative
One of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart .
negative
No better or worse than ` Truth or Consequences , N.M. ' or any other interchangeable actioner with imbecilic Mafia toolbags botching a routine assignment in a Western backwater .
negative
( MacDowell ) ventures beyond her abilities several times here and reveals how bad an actress she is .
negative
I can imagine this movie as a b & w British comedy , circa 1960 , with Peter Sellers , Kenneth Williams , et al. , but at this time , with this cast , this movie is hopeless .
negative
Talky , artificial and opaque ... an interesting technical exercise , but a tedious picture .
negative
And in a sense , that 's a liability .
negative
It 's easy to love Robin Tunney -- she 's pretty and she can act -- but it gets harder and harder to understand her choices .
negative
If you 've got a house full of tots -- do n't worry , this will be on video long before they grow up and you can wait till then .

The new film of Anton Chekhov 's The Cherry Orchard puts the ` ick ' in ` classic . '
negative
If I want music , I 'll buy the soundtrack .
negative
If I want a real movie , I 'll buy the Criterion DVD .
negative
Writer-director Stephen Gaghan has made the near-fatal mistake of being what the English call ` too clever by half . '
negative
Seagal ran out of movies years ago , and this is just the proof .
negative
The movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it .
negative
An awkwardly garish showcase that diverges from anything remotely probing or penetrating .
negative
Jackass is a vulgar and cheap-looking version of Candid Camera staged for the Marquis de Sade set .
negative
Children , Christian or otherwise , deserve to hear the full story of Jonah 's despair -- in all its agonizing , Catch-22 glory -- even if they spend years trying to comprehend it .
positive
Pleasant but not more than recycled jock piffle .
negative
... the kind of movie you see because the theater has air conditioning .
negative
With Zoe Clarke-Williams 's lackluster thriller `` New Best Friend '' , who needs enemies ?
negative
Just another generic drama that has nothing going for it other than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap thrills .
negative
Hip-hop prison thriller of stupefying absurdity .
negative
An uneven mix of dark satire and childhood awakening .
negative
The film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based ` drama , ' but the emphasis on the latter leaves Blue Crush waterlogged .
negative
The problem is the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage .
negative
The images lack contrast , are murky and are frequently too dark to be decipherable .
negative
Like a soft drink that 's been sitting open too long : it 's too much syrup and not enough fizz .
negative
As the movie dragged on , I thought I heard a mysterious voice , and felt myself powerfully drawn toward the light -- the light of the exit sign .
negative
I have returned from the beyond to warn you : this movie is 90 minutes long , and life is too short .
negative
There are some fairly unsettling scenes , but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer .
negative
In the end , The Weight of Water comes to resemble the kind of soft-core twaddle you 'd expect to see on Showtime 's ` Red Shoe Diaries . '
negative
A straight-ahead thriller that never rises above superficiality .
negative
Glizty but formulaic and silly ... Cagney 's ` top of the world ' has been replaced by the bottom of the barrel .
negative
The re - enactments , however fascinating they may be as history , are too crude to serve the work especially well .
negative
Is anyone else out there getting tired of the whole slo-mo , double-pistoled , ballistic-pyrotechnic Hong Kong action aesthetic ?
negative
Once again , director Chris Columbus takes a hat-in-hand approach to Rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours .
negative
Serving Sara is little more than a mall movie designed to kill time .
negative
Too smart to ignore but a little too smugly superior to like , this could be a movie that ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot .
negative
The most repugnant adaptation of a classic text since Roland Joffé and Demi Moore 's The Scarlet Letter .
negative
It never plays as dramatic even when dramatic things happen to people .
negative
It labours as storytelling .
negative
The Adventures of Pluto Nash is a whole lot of nada .
negative
A really good premise is frittered away in middle-of-the-road blandness .
negative
Lawrence should stick to his day job .
negative
He 's a better actor than a standup comedian .
positive
Despite the fact that this film was n't as bad as I thought it was going to be , it 's still not a good movie
negative
A well made indieflick in need of some trims and a more chemistry between its stars .
positive
I never thought I 'd say this , but I 'd much rather watch teens poking their genitals into fruit pies !
negative
A film neither bitter nor sweet , neither romantic nor comedic , neither warm nor fuzzy .
positive
Tiresomely derivative and hammily acted .
negative
We never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they 'll wind up together , and Michele 's spiritual quest is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest .
negative
The plot grows thin soon , and you find yourself praying for a quick resolution .
negative
Too bad Maggio could n't come up with a better script .
negative
Much of the cast is stiff or just plain bad .
negative
Rice is too pedestrian a filmmaker to bring any edge or personality to The Rising Place that would set it apart from other Deep South stories .
negative
At best , Cletis Tout might inspire a trip to the video store -- in search of a better movie experience .
negative
Witless , pointless , tasteless and idiotic .
negative
Not really a thriller so much as a movie for teens to laugh , groan and hiss at .
negative
As plain and pedestrian as catsup --
negative
An improvement on the feeble examples of big-screen Poke-mania that have preceded it .
positive
Whatever satire Lucky Break was aiming for , it certainly got lost in the `` soon-to-be-forgettable '' section of the quirky rip-off prison romp pile .
negative
It 's petty thievery like this that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars
negative
The package in which this fascinating -- and timely -- content comes wrapped is disappointingly generic .
negative
Guys say mean things and shoot a lot of bullets .
negative
Some of the characters die and others do n't , and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson , and , really , nobody in the viewing audience cares .
negative
Wildly incompetent but brilliantly named Half Past Dead -- or for Seagal pessimists : Totally Past His Prime .
negative
Just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence ... lacking the slightest bit of wit or charm .
negative
All the movie 's narrative gymnastics ca n't disguise the fact that it 's inauthentic at its core and that its story just is n't worth telling .
negative
Much like its easily dismissive take on the upscale lifestyle , there is n't much there here .
negative
The film ultimately offers nothing more than people in an urban jungle needing other people to survive ...
negative
For all its shoot-outs , fistfights , and car chases , this movie is a phlegmatic bore , so tedious it makes the silly spy vs. spy film The Sum of All Fears , starring Ben Affleck , seem downright Hitchcockian .
negative
This mild-mannered farce , directed by one of its writers , John C. Walsh , is corny in a way that bespeaks an expiration date passed a long time ago .
negative
A bit too eager to please .
negative
You 'd be hard put to find a movie character more unattractive or odorous ( than Leon ) .
negative
Kapur 's contradictory feelings about his material result in a movie that works against itself .
negative
`` the road paved with good intentions leads to the video store ''
positive
Animated drivel meant to enhance the self-image of drooling idiots .
negative
One scene after another in this supposedly funny movie falls to the floor with a sickening thud .
negative
` The Château is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot . '
negative
Jacobi , the most fluent of actors , is given relatively dry material from Nijinsky 's writings to perform , and the visuals , even erotically frank ones , become dullingly repetitive .
negative
Crudup 's screen presence is the one thing that holds interest in the midst of a mushy , existential exploration of why men leave their families .
positive
Despite terrific special effects and funnier gags , Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets finds a way to make J.K. Rowling 's marvelous series into a deadly bore .
negative
An incredibly narrow in-joke targeted to the tiniest segment of an already obscure demographic .
negative
The only thing I laughed at were the people who paid to see it .
negative
All of the elements are in place for a great film noir , but director George Hickenlooper 's approach to the material is too upbeat .
negative
The hackneyed story about an affluent damsel in distress who decides to fight her bully of a husband is simply too overdone .
negative
Then you get another phone call warning you that if the video is n't back at Blockbuster before midnight , you 're going to face frightening late fees .
negative
Possibly the most irresponsible picture ever released by a major film studio .
negative
... a cheap , ludicrous attempt at serious horror .
negative
Those of you who are not an eighth grade girl will most likely doze off during this one .
negative
Befuddled in its characterizations as it begins to seem as long as the two year affair which is its subject
negative
The movie would seem less of a trifle if Ms. Sugarman followed through on her defiance of the saccharine .
negative
It 's just not very smart .
negative
Like the excruciating End of Days , Collateral Damage presents Schwarzenegger as a tragic figure , but sympathy really belongs with any viewer forced to watch him try out so many complicated facial expressions .
negative
Imagine ( if possible ) a Pasolini film without passion or politics , or an Almodovar movie without beauty or humor , and you have some idea of the glum , numb experience of watching O Fantasma .
negative
90 punitive minutes of eardrum-dicing gunplay , screeching-metal smashups , and flaccid odd-couple sniping .
negative
Sadly , though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear , they ca n't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction .
negative
Never capitalizes on this concept and opts for the breezy and amateurish feel of an after school special on the subject of tolerance .
negative
After a while , Hoffman 's quirks and mannerisms , particularly his penchant for tearing up on cue -- things that seem so real in small doses -- become annoying and artificial .
negative
This wretchedly unfunny wannabe comedy is inane and awful - no doubt , it 's the worst movie I 've seen this summer .
negative
It 's drab .
negative
It 's uninteresting .
negative
It squanders Chan 's uniqueness ; it could even be said to squander Jennifer Love Hewitt !
negative
The movie keeps coming back to the achingly unfunny Phonce and his several silly subplots .
negative
This tale has been told and retold ; the races and rackets change , but the song remains the same .
negative
A surprisingly flat retread , hobbled by half-baked setups and sluggish pacing .
negative
Forget the Psychology 101 study of romantic obsession and just watch the procession of costumes in castles and this wo n't seem like such a bore .
negative
A film that should be relegated to a dark video store corner is somehow making its way instead to theaters .
negative
It 's hard to imagine acting that could be any flatter .
negative
New ways of describing badness need to be invented to describe exactly how bad it is .
negative
Lots of effort and intelligence are on display but in execution it is all awkward , static , and lifeless rumblings .
negative
When cowering and begging at the feet a scruffy Giannini , Madonna gives her best performance since Abel Ferrara had her beaten to a pulp in his Dangerous Game .
positive
I suspect that there are more interesting ways of dealing with the subject .
negative
The film itself is about something very interesting and odd that would probably work better as a real documentary without the insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative .
negative
Their parents would do well to cram earplugs in their ears and put pillowcases over their heads for 87 minutes .
negative
For all its violence , the movie is remarkably dull with only Caine making much of an impression .
negative
A sub-formulaic slap in the face to seasonal cheer .
negative
Several uninteresting , unlikeable people do bad things to and with each other in `` Unfaithful . ''
negative
Why anyone who is not a character in this movie should care is beyond me .
negative
Hill looks to be going through the motions , beginning with the pale script .
negative
Howard conjures the past via surrealist flourishes so overwrought you 'd swear he just stepped out of a Buñuel retrospective .
positive
It 's not a bad premise , just a bad movie .
negative
An already thin story boils down to surviving invaders seeking an existent anti-virus .
negative
By the time the surprise ending is revealed , interest can not be revived .
negative
The heedless impetuousness of youth is on full , irritating display in ( this ) meandering and pointless French coming-of-age import from writer-director Anne-Sophie Birot .
negative
A peculiar misfire that even Tunney ca n't save .
negative
Watching Queen of the Damned is like reading a research paper , with special effects tossed in .
negative
I ca n't remember the last time I saw worse stunt editing or cheaper action movie production values than in Extreme Ops .
negative
Too much of Nemesis has a tired , talky feel .
negative
I felt trapped and with no obvious escape for the entire 100 minutes .
negative
Leaves us wondering less about its ideas and more about its characterization of Hitler and the contrived nature of its provocative conclusion .
negative
It is that rare combination of bad writing , bad direction and bad acting -- the trifecta of badness .
negative
A soulless jumble of ineptly assembled cliches and pabulum that plays like a 95-minute commercial for NBA properties .
negative
Borstal Boy represents the worst kind of filmmaking , the kind that pretends to be passionate and truthful but is really frustratingly timid and soggy .
negative
The film 's lack of personality permeates all its aspects -- from the TV movie-esque , affected child acting to the dullest Irish pub scenes ever filmed .
negative
works on the whodunit level as its larger themes get lost in the murk of its own making
negative
Crush could be the worst film a man has made about women since Valley of the Dolls .
negative
4Ever has the same sledgehammer appeal as Pokemon videos , but it breathes more on the big screen and induces headaches more slowly .
positive
Feels like the work of someone who may indeed have finally aged past his prime ... and , perhaps more than he realizes , just wants to be liked by the people who can still give him work .
negative
Viewers of Barney 's crushingly self-indulgent spectacle will see nothing in it to match the ordeal of sitting through it .
negative
Sayles ... once again strands his superb performers in the same old story .
negative
The Piano Teacher , like its title character , is repellantly out of control .
negative
I have to admit I walked out of Runteldat .
negative
I did go back and check out the last 10 minutes , but these were more repulsive than the first 30 or 40 minutes .
negative
There 's already been too many of these films ...
negative
Several of Steven Soderbergh 's earlier films were hailed as the works of an artist .
positive
Sadly , Full Frontal plays like the work of a dilettante .
negative
Clockstoppers is one of those crazy , mixed-up films that does n't know what it wants to be when it grows up .
negative
` The War of the Roses , ' trailer-trash style .
negative
Supposedly , Pokemon ca n't be killed , but Pokemon 4Ever practically assures that the pocket monster movie franchise is nearly ready to keel over .
negative
White has n't developed characters so much as caricatures , one-dimensional buffoons that get him a few laughs but nothing else .
negative
The film feels formulaic , its plot and pacing typical Hollywood war-movie stuff , while the performances elicit more of a sense of deja vu than awe .
negative
This overproduced piece of dreck is shockingly bad and absolutely unnecessary .
negative
Hmmm ... might I suggest that the wayward wooden one end it all by stuffing himself into an electric pencil sharpener ?
negative
The makers of Mothman Prophecies succeed in producing that most frightening of all movies -- a mediocre horror film too bad to be good and too good to be bad .
negative
Mr. Deeds is not really a film as much as it is a loose collection of not-so-funny gags , scattered moments of lazy humor .
negative
How this one escaped the Lifetime network I 'll never know .
negative
Could n't someone take Rob Schneider and have him switch bodies with a funny person ?
negative
One of these days Hollywood will come up with an original idea for a teen movie , but until then there 's always these rehashes to feed to the younger generations .
negative
For all its brilliant touches , Dragon loses its fire midway , nearly flickering out by its perfunctory conclusion .
negative
I have to admit that I am baffled by Jason X.
negative
A mean-spirited film made by someone who surely read The Catcher in the Rye but clearly suffers from dyslexia
negative
Instead of a witty expose on the banality and hypocrisy of too much kid-vid , we get an ugly , mean-spirited lashing out by an adult who 's apparently been forced by his kids to watch too many Barney videos .
negative
This is a film living far too much in its own head .
negative
Dogtown is hollow , self-indulgent , and - worst of all - boring .
negative
A movie so bad that it quickly enters the pantheon of wreckage that includes Battlefield Earth and Showgirls .
negative
It 's just too bad the screenwriters eventually shoot themselves in the feet with cop flick cliches like an oily arms dealer , squad car pile-ups and the requisite screaming captain .
negative
To be influenced chiefly by humanity 's greatest shame , reality shows -- reality shows for God 's sake !
negative
-- is a crime that should be punishable by chainsaw .
negative
A frustrating ` tweener ' -- too slick , contrived and exploitative for the art houses and too cynical , small and decadent for the malls .
negative
What 's surprising about this traditional thriller , moderately successful but not completely satisfying , is exactly how genteel and unsurprising the execution turns out to be .
positive
Drowning 's too good for this sucker .
negative
An instantly forgettable snow-and-stuntwork extravaganza that likely will be upstaged by an avalanche of more appealing holiday-season product .
negative
Frankly , it 's pretty stupid .
negative
But there 's plenty to offend everyone ...
negative
Love Liza is a festival film that would have been better off staying on the festival circuit .
negative
Quite frankly , I ca n't see why any actor of talent would ever work in a McCulloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out .
negative
My precious new Star Wars movie is a lumbering , wheezy drag ...
negative
Too campy to work as straight drama and too violent and sordid to function as comedy , Vulgar is , truly and thankfully , a one-of-a-kind work .
negative
Horrid little propaganda film with fascinating connections not only to the Serbs themselves but also to a network of American right-wing extremists .
positive
Should have gone straight to video .
negative
It looks like an action movie , but it 's so poorly made , on all levels , that it does n't even qualify as a spoof of such .
negative
It is supremely unfunny and unentertaining to watch middle-age and older men drink to excess , piss on trees , b.s. one another and put on a show in drag .
negative
Consider the film a celluloid litmus test for the intellectual and emotional pedigree of your date and a giant step backward for a director I admire .
negative
A boring , pretentious muddle that uses a sensational , real-life 19th-Century crime as a metaphor for -- well , I 'm not exactly sure what -- and has all the dramatic weight of a raindrop .
negative
Sheridan had a wonderful account to work from , but , curiously , he waters it down , turning grit and vulnerability into light reading .
negative
Heavy with flabby rolls of typical Toback machinations .
negative
It is very difficult to care about the character , and that is the central flaw of the film .
negative
Snow Dogs finds its humour in a black man getting humiliated by a pack of dogs who are smarter than him
negative
Whole stretches of the film may be incomprehensible to moviegoers not already clad in basic black .
negative
Reggio and Glass so rhapsodize cynicism , with repetition and languorous slo-mo sequences , that Glass 's dirgelike score becomes a fang-baring lullaby .
negative
Ends up offering nothing more than the latest Schwarzenegger or Stallone flick would .
negative
If The Tuxedo actually were a suit , it would fit Chan like a $ 99 bargain-basement special .
negative
Parents beware ; this is downright movie penance .
negative
... a complete shambles of a movie so sloppy , so uneven , so damn unpleasant that I ca n't believe any viewer , young or old , would have a good time here .
negative
Has nothing good to speak about other than the fact that it is relatively short , tries its best to hide the fact that Seagal 's overweight and out of shape .
negative
A pathetically inane and unimaginative cross between XXX and Vertical Limit .
negative
Feels at times like a giant commercial for Universal Studios , where much of the action takes place .
negative
Britney Spears ' phoniness is nothing compared to the movie 's contrived , lame screenplay and listless direction .
negative
Every sequel you skip will be two hours gained .
negative
But it has an ambition to say something about its subjects , but not a willingness .
negative
Twenty-three movies into a mostly magnificent directorial career , Clint Eastwood 's efficiently minimalist style finally has failed him .
negative
It should have stayed there .
negative
But the feelings evoked in the film are lukewarm and quick to pass .
negative
The most opaque , self-indulgent and just plain goofy an excuse for a movie as you can imagine .
negative
Big Fat Liar is little more than Home Alone raised to a new , self-deprecating level .
negative
Loses its sense of humor in a vat of failed jokes , twitchy acting , and general boorishness .
negative
There 's a delightfully quirky movie to be made from curling , but Brooms is n't it .
negative
The story suffers a severe case of oversimplification , superficiality and silliness .
negative
Chamber of Secrets will find millions of eager fans .
positive
But if the essence of magic is its make-believe promise of life that soars above the material realm , this is the opposite of a truly magical movie .
negative
Too clever by about nine-tenths .
positive
Has all the hallmarks of a movie designed strictly for children 's home video , a market so insatiable it absorbs all manner of lame entertainment , as long as 3-year-olds find it diverting .
negative
Bears about as much resemblance to the experiences of most battered women as Spider-Man does to the experiences of most teenagers .
negative
Toward the end Sum of All Fears morphs into a mundane '70s disaster flick .
negative
Director Carl Franklin , so crisp and economical in One False Move , bogs down in genre cliches here .
positive
Mendes still does n't quite know how to fill a frame .
negative
Like the Hanks character , he 's a slow study : The action is stilted and the tabloid energy embalmed .
negative
This thing is just garbage .
negative
There must be an audience that enjoys the Friday series , but I would n't be interested in knowing any of them personally .
negative
A bold ( and lovely ) experiment that will almost certainly bore most audiences into their own brightly colored dreams .
positive
An empty exercise , a florid but ultimately vapid crime melodrama with lots of surface flash but little emotional resonance .
negative
If you are curious to see the darker side of what 's going on with young TV actors ( Dawson Leery did what ?!? ) , or see some interesting storytelling devices , you might want to check it out , but there 's nothing very attractive about this movie .
negative
My own minority report is that it stinks .
negative
Trying to make head or tail of the story in the hip-hop indie Snipes is enough to give you brain strain -- and the pay-off is negligible .
negative
The script is high on squaddie banter , low on shocks .
positive
... if you , like me , think an action film disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with , then you 're in for a painful ride .
negative
While Solondz tries and tries hard , Storytelling fails to provide much more insight than the inside column of a torn book jacket .
negative
With very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors like Swimming With Sharks and The Player , this latest skewering ... may put off insiders and outsiders alike .
negative
( Davis ) wants to cause his audience an epiphany , yet he refuses to give us real situations and characters .
negative
Without a fresh infusion of creativity , 4Ever is neither a promise nor a threat so much as wishful thinking .
negative
... unlike ( Scorsese 's Mean Streets ) , Ash Wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot .
negative
Being unique does n't necessarily equate to being good , no matter how admirably the filmmakers have gone for broke .
negative
A few hours after you 've seen it , you forget you 've been to the movies .
negative
waydowntown may not be an important movie , or even a good one , but it provides a nice change of mindless pace in collision with the hot Oscar season currently underway .
positive
Yes , I suppose it 's lovely that Cal works out his issues with his dad and comes to terms with his picture-perfect life -- but World Traveler gave me no reason to care , so I did n't .
negative
It is not the first time that director Sara Sugarman stoops to having characters drop their pants for laughs and not the last time she fails to provoke them .
negative
I 'd be hard pressed to think of a film more cloyingly sappy than Evelyn this year .
negative
Nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises .
negative
What remains is a variant of the nincompoop Benigni persona , here a more annoying , though less angry version of the irresponsible Sandlerian manchild , undercut by the voice of the star of Road Trip .
negative
A backhanded ode to female camaraderie penned by a man who has little clue about either the nature of women or of friendship .
negative
Take away the controversy , and it 's not much more watchable than a Mexican soap opera .
negative
It 's got the brawn , but not the brains .
negative
Mindless and boring martial arts and gunplay with too little excitement and zero compelling storyline .
negative
A lot of talent is wasted in this crass , low-wattage endeavor .
negative
( T ) oo many of these gross out scenes ...
negative
About one in three gags in White 's intermittently wise script hits its mark ; the rest are padding unashamedly appropriated from the teen-exploitation playbook .
negative
Little is done to support the premise other than fling gags at it to see which ones shtick .
negative
One of those films that seems tailor made to air on pay cable to offer some modest amusements when one has nothing else to watch .
negative
The big ending surprise almost saves the movie .
positive
It 's probably not easy to make such a worthless film ...
negative
Has no reason to exist , other than to employ Hollywood kids and people who owe favors to their famous parents .
negative
For a guy who has waited three years with breathless anticipation for a new Hal Hartley movie to pore over , No Such Thing is a big letdown .
negative
Constantly slips from the grasp of its maker .
negative
` Christian Bale 's Quinn ( is ) a leather clad grunge-pirate with a hairdo like Gandalf in a wind-tunnel and a simply astounding cor-blimey-luv-a-duck cockney accent . '
negative
After you laugh once ( maybe twice ) , you will have completely forgotten the movie by the time you get back to your car in the parking lot .
negative
In the era of The Sopranos , it feels painfully redundant and inauthentic .
negative
The overall vibe is druggy and self-indulgent , like a spring-break orgy for pretentious arts majors .
negative
Breen 's script is sketchy with actorish notations on the margin of acting .
negative
If only Merchant paid more attention the story .
negative
At the one-hour mark , Herzog simply runs out of ideas and the pace turns positively leaden as the movie sputters to its inevitable tragic conclusion .
negative
... too contrived to be as naturally charming as it needs to be .
negative
A simpler , leaner treatment would have been preferable ; after all , being about nothing is sometimes funnier than being about something .
negative
The characters are based on stock clichés , and the attempt to complicate the story only defies credibility .
negative
Everything about it from the bland songs to the colorful but flat drawings is completely serviceable and quickly forgettable .
negative
Not the Great American Comedy , but if you liked the previous movies in the series , you 'll have a good time with this one too .
positive
A domestic melodrama with weak dialogue and biopic cliches .
negative
Mr. Goyer 's loose , unaccountable direction is technically sophisticated in the worst way .
negative
The movie is so thoughtlessly assembled .
positive
plays like some corny television production from a bygone era
negative
The end result is like cold porridge with only the odd enjoyably chewy lump .
negative
For all the charm of Kevin Kline and a story that puts old-fashioned values under the microscope , there 's something creepy about this movie .
positive
I was feeling this movie until it veered off too far into the Exxon zone , and left me behind at the station looking for a return ticket to realism .
negative
Producer John Penotti surveyed high school students ... and came back with the astonishing revelation that `` they wanted to see something that did n't talk down to them . ''
positive
Ignoring that , he made Swimfan anyway
negative
Naipaul fans may be disappointed .
negative
Those who are not acquainted with the author 's work , on the other hand , may fall fast asleep .
negative
Hoffman waits too long to turn his movie in an unexpected direction , and even then his tone retains a genteel , prep-school quality that feels dusty and leatherbound .
negative
If you 're looking for a story , do n't bother .
negative
Full Frontal had no effect and elicited no sympathies for any of the characters .
negative
By that measure , it is a failure .
negative
A baffling mixed platter of gritty realism and magic realism with a hard-to-swallow premise .
negative
An affable but undernourished romantic comedy that fails to match the freshness of the actress-producer and writer 's previous collaboration , Miss Congeniality .
negative
Like a pack of dynamite sticks , built for controversy .
negative
An admitted egomaniac , Evans is no Hollywood villain , and yet this grating showcase almost makes you wish he 'd gone the way of Don Simpson .
negative
The audience when I saw this one was chuckling at all the wrong times , and that 's a bad sign when they 're supposed to be having a collective heart attack .
negative
Everyone 's to blame here .
negative
You get the impression that writer and director Burr Steers knows the territory ... but his sense of humor has yet to lose the smug self-satisfaction usually associated with the better private schools .
negative
Less a study in madness or love than a study in schoolgirl obsession .
negative
Rice never clearly defines his characters or gives us a reason to care about them .
negative
But what is missing from it all is a moral .
negative
Why did they deem it necessary to document all this emotional misery ?
negative
You see the movie and you think , zzzzzzzzz .
negative
Downright transparent is the script 's endless assault of embarrassingly ham-fisted sex jokes that reek of a script rewrite designed to garner the film a `` cooler '' PG-13 rating .
negative
The movie slides downhill as soon as macho action conventions assert themselves .
negative
Formulaic to the 51st power , more like .
negative
Howard and his co-stars all give committed performances , but they 're often undone by Howard 's self-conscious attempts to find a ` literary ' filmmaking style to match his subject .
negative
Comes off more like a misdemeanor , a flat , unconvincing drama that never catches fire .
negative
Offers absolutely nothing I had n't already seen .
negative
`` Analyze That '' is one of those crass , contrived sequels that not only fails on its own , but makes you second-guess your affection for the original .
negative
Suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled .
negative
Complex , sinuously plotted and , somehow , off-puttingly cold .
negative
First-time writer-director Dylan Kidd also has a good ear for dialogue , and the characters sound like real people .
positive
... an airless , prepackaged Julia Roberts wannabe that stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering you 'll wonder if Lopez 's publicist should share screenwriting credit .
negative
Goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures , and it looks as though Jay Roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab .
negative
Could as easily have been called ` Under Siege 3 : In Alcatraz ' ... a cinematic corpse that never springs to life .
negative
In comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class London life ; despite the title ... amounts to surprisingly little .
negative
Lame Sweet Home leaves no Southern stereotype unturned .
negative
The jokes are sophomoric , stereotypes are sprinkled everywhere and the acting ranges from bad to bodacious .
negative
Will give many ministers and Bible-study groups hours of material to discuss .
positive
But mainstream audiences will find little of interest in this film , which is often preachy and poorly acted .
negative
In its chicken heart , Crush goes to absurd lengths to duck the very issues it raises .
negative
This long and relentlessly saccharine film is a clear case of preaching to the converted .
negative
The film is flat .
negative
The movie is a lumbering load of hokum but ... it 's at least watchable .
negative
An unbelievably stupid film , though occasionally fun enough to make you forget its absurdity .
negative
The first Fatal Attraction was vile enough .
negative
Do we really need the Tiger Beat version ?
negative
This Bond film goes off the beaten path , not necessarily for the better .
negative
The problem is that the movie has no idea of it is serious or not .
negative
When the fire burns out , we 've only come face-to-face with a couple dragons and that 's where the film ultimately fails .
negative
The elements were all there but lack of a pyschological center knocks it flat .
negative
An unsuccessful attempt at a movie of ideas .
negative
Queen of the Damned as you might have guessed , makes sorry use of Aaliyah in her one and only starring role -- she does little here but point at things that explode into flame .
negative
This toothless Dog , already on cable , loses all bite on the big screen .
negative
It made me feel unclean , and I 'm the guy who liked There 's Something About Mary and both American Pie movies .
negative
Not only is it hokey , manipulative and as bland as Wonder Bread dipped in milk , but it also does the absolute last thing we need Hollywood doing to us : It preaches .
negative
It 's so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments that it 's left a few crucial things out , like character development and coherence .
negative
Serving Sara should be served an eviction notice at every theater stuck with it .
negative
A loud , low-budget and tired formula film that arrives cloaked in the euphemism ` urban drama . '
negative
The movie has a script ( by Paul Pender ) made of wood , and it 's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions .
negative
A pathetic exploitation film that tries to seem sincere , and just seems worse for the effort .
negative
At some point , all this visual trickery stops being clever and devolves into flashy , vaguely silly overkill .
negative
Despite some charm and heart , this quirky soccer import is forgettable
negative
Meyjes 's movie , like Max Rothman 's future , does not work .
negative
What 's needed so badly but what is virtually absent here is either a saving dark humor or the feel of poetic tragedy .
negative
Schneidermeister ... Makin ' a fool of himself ... Losin ' his fan base ...
negative
Not once does it come close to being exciting .
negative
One of those strained caper movies that 's hardly any fun to watch and begins to vaporize from your memory minutes after it ends .
negative
Needed a little less bling-bling and a lot more romance .
negative
It 's hard to believe these jokers are supposed to have pulled off four similar kidnappings before .
negative
I 'm not exactly sure what this movie thinks it is about .
negative
Cal is an unpleasantly shallow and immature character with whom to spend 110 claustrophobic minutes .
negative
The bottom line , at least in my opinion , is Imposter makes a better short story than it does a film .
negative
It is just too bad the film 's story does not live up to its style .
negative
Unless you 're a fanatic , the best advice is : ` Scooby ' do n't .
negative
A cautionary tale about the folly of superficiality that is itself endlessly superficial .
negative
If you 're looking to rekindle the magic of the first film , you 'll need a stronger stomach than us .
negative
Shreve 's graceful dual narrative gets clunky on the screen , and we keep getting torn away from the compelling historical tale to a less-compelling soap opera .
negative
Contains a few big laughs but many more that graze the funny bone or miss it altogether , in part because the consciously dumbed-down approach wears thin .
negative
Nothing more than a widget cranked out on an assembly line to see if stupid Americans will get a kick out of goofy Brits with cute accents performing ages-old slapstick and unfunny tricks .
negative
This is a film tailor-made for those who when they were in high school would choose the Cliff-Notes over reading a full-length classic .
negative
The movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that 's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads .
negative
A jumbled fantasy comedy that did not figure out a coherent game plan at scripting , shooting or post-production stages .
negative
A sad and rote exercise in milking a played-out idea -- a straight guy has to dress up in drag -- that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title would imply .
negative
We hate ( Madonna ) within the film 's first five minutes , and she lacks the skill or presence to regain any ground .
negative
Sounding like Arnold Schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , ( Ahola ) has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that does n't produce any real transformation .
negative
Two big things are missing -- anything approaching a visceral kick , and anything approaching even a vague reason to sit through it all .
negative
Scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company .
negative
And as with most late-night bull sessions , eventually the content is n't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is .
negative
Too stagey , talky -- and long -- for its own good .
negative
Apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap .
negative
The sinister inspiration that fuelled DeVito 's early work is confused in Death to Smoochy into something both ugly and mindless .
negative
Despite Auteuil 's performance , it 's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug .
negative
Never comes together as a coherent whole .
negative
An unintentionally surreal kid 's picture ... in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a VH1 Behind the Music episode .
negative
First , for a movie that tries to be smart , it 's kinda dumb .
negative
And second , what 's with all the shooting ?
negative
Do n't even bother to rent this on video .
negative
There is something in Full Frontal , I guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see .
negative
This is the kind of movie that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in September .
negative
Not counting a few gross-out comedies I 've been trying to forget , this is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes .
negative
Plays like one long , meandering sketch inspired by the works of John Waters and Todd Solondz , rather than a fully developed story .
negative
The film does n't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made Spy Kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences .
negative
A mawkish self-parody that plays like some weird Masterpiece Theater sketch with neither a point of view nor a compelling reason for being .
negative
An average B-movie with no aspirations to be anything more .
negative
The plot is plastered with one Hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults .
negative
A film that suffers because of its many excesses .
negative
Too bland and fustily tasteful to be truly prurient .
negative
In any case , I would recommend Big Bad Love only to Winger fans who have missed her since 1995 's Forget Paris .
negative
But even then , I 'd recommend waiting for DVD and just skipping straight to her scenes .
negative
Depicts the sorriest and most sordid of human behavior on the screen , then laughs at how clever it 's being .
negative
Nijinsky says , ' I know how to suffer ' and if you see this film you 'll know too .
negative
` CQ may one day be fondly remembered as Roman Coppola 's brief pretentious period before going on to other films that actually tell a story worth caring about
negative
The only thing scary about feardotcom is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie .
negative
... the story simply putters along looking for astute observations and coming up blank .
negative
Instead of contriving a climactic hero 's death for the beloved-major - character-who-shall - remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens ' laser guns actually hit something for once ?
negative
It just did n't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on ( or be entertained by ) .
negative
This action-thriller/dark comedy is one of the most repellent things to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage .
negative
MIB II is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything .
negative
That 's because relatively nothing happens .
negative
No amount of arty theorizing -- the special effects are ` German-Expressionist , ' according to the press notes -- can render it anything but laughable .
negative
Blue Crush follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling .
negative
Boyd 's screenplay ( co-written with Guardian hack Nick Davies ) has a florid turn of phrase that owes more to Guy Ritchie than the Bard of Avon .
negative
There 's not a spark of new inspiration in it , just more of the same , done with noticeably less energy and imagination .
negative
Jackson shamefully strolls through this mess with a smug grin , inexplicably wearing a kilt and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder .
negative
A moving picture that does not move .
negative
Romething 's really wrong with this ricture !
negative
Its salient points are simultaneously buried , drowned and smothered in the excesses of writer-director Roger Avary .
negative
I 'm not sure these words have ever been together in the same sentence : This erotic cannibal movie is boring .
negative
` God help us , but Capra and Cooper are rolling over in their graves . '
negative
... an hour-and-a-half of inoffensive , unmemorable filler .
negative
Is it a comedy ?
negative
A cartoon ?
negative
Yes .
positive
No. .
negative
And that is where Ararat went astray .
negative
It 's a bad sign in a thriller when you instantly know whodunit .
negative
Has a customarily jovial air but a deficit of flim-flam inventiveness .
negative
Eight Legged Freaks wo n't join the pantheon of great monster/science fiction flicks that we have come to love ...
negative
It gets the details of its time frame right but it completely misses its emotions .
negative
Who , exactly , is fighting whom here ?
negative
Ah , yes , that would be me : fighting off the urge to doze .
negative
A kilted Jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces .
negative
Contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster .
negative
Starts out with tremendous promise , introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter .
negative
The film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises .
negative
The only question ... is to determine how well the schmaltz is manufactured -- to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering .
negative
Average , at best , I 'm afraid .
negative
This movie is so bad , that it 's almost worth seeing because it 's so bad .
negative
This movie feel more like a non-stop cry for attention , than an attempt at any kind of satisfying entertainment .
negative
Love may have been in the air onscreen , but I certainly was n't feeling any of it .
negative
In addition to the overcooked , ham-fisted direction , which has all the actors reaching for the back row , the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry .
negative
The very definition of what critics have come to term an `` ambitious failure . ''
negative
It 's as if De Palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up Kraft Macaroni and Cheese .
negative
The movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter ` uhhh , ' which is better than most of the writing in the movie .
negative
Worthy of the gong .
negative
While certainly more naturalistic than its Australian counterpart , Amari 's film falls short in building the drama of Lilia 's journey .
negative
I found the movie as divided against itself as the dysfunctional family it portrays .
negative
The soul-searching deliberateness of the film , although leavened nicely with dry absurdist wit , eventually becomes too heavy for the plot .
negative
The movie does n't add anything fresh to the myth .
negative
As inept as big-screen remakes of The Avengers and The Wild Wild West .
negative
Comes across as a relic from a bygone era , and its convolutions ... feel silly rather than plausible .
negative
Moves in such odd plot directions and descends into such message-mongering moralism that its good qualities are obscured .
negative
It 's a very sincere work , but it would be better as a diary or documentary .
positive
Once one experiences Mr. Haneke 's own sadistic tendencies toward his audience , one is left with a sour taste in one 's mouth , and little else .
negative
That chirpy songbird Britney Spears has popped up with more mindless drivel .
negative
It 's a loathsome movie , it really is and it makes absolutely no sense .
negative
A chiller resolutely without chills .
negative
For those of us who respond more strongly to storytelling than computer-generated effects , the new Star Wars installment has n't escaped the rut dug by the last one .
negative
The director mostly plays it straight , turning Leys ' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder .
negative
`` Bad '' is the operative word for `` Bad Company , '' and I do n't mean that in a good way .
negative
Though Frida is easier to swallow than Julie Taymor 's preposterous Titus , the eye candy here lacks considerable brio .
negative
Drumline is -- the mere suggestion , albeit a visually compelling one , of a fully realized story .
positive
The whole movie is simply a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking that asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well .
negative
Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro sleepwalk through vulgarities in a sequel you can refuse .
negative
It 's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert .
negative
Merely ( and literally ) tosses around sex toys and offers half-hearted paeans to empowerment that are repeatedly undercut by the brutality of the jokes , most at women 's expense .
negative
If you want a movie time trip , the 1960 version is a far smoother ride .
negative
The story is -- forgive me -- a little thin , and the filmmaking clumsy and rushed .
negative
... grows decidedly flimsier with its many out-sized , out of character and logically porous action set pieces .
negative
This would have been better than the fiction it has concocted , and there still could have been room for the war scenes .
negative
Aggressive self-glorification and a manipulative whitewash .
negative
Stay for the credits and see a devastating comic impersonation by Dustin Hoffman that is revelatory .
positive
None of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest .
negative
The whole film has this sneaky feel to it -- as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as Very Important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a Hollywood product .
negative
The only way to tolerate this insipid , brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers .
negative
Coppola has made a film of intoxicating atmosphere and little else .
positive
Bad and baffling from the get-go .
negative
A series of immaculately composed shots of Patch Adams quietly freaking out does not make for much of a movie .
negative
At a time when we 've learned the hard way just how complex international terrorism is , Collateral Damage paints an absurdly simplistic picture .
negative
Like a can of 2-day old Coke .
negative
You can taste it , but there 's no fizz .
negative
There 's no excuse for following up a delightful , well-crafted family film with a computer-generated cold fish .
negative
But they do n't fit well together and neither is well told .
negative
It 's both sitcomishly predictable and cloying in its attempts to be poignant .
negative
Other than a mildly engaging central romance , Hospital is sickly entertainment at best and mind-destroying cinematic pollution at worst .
negative
Jaglom offers the none-too-original premise that everyone involved with moviemaking is a con artist and a liar .
negative
Outside of Burger 's desire to make some kind of film , it 's really unclear why this project was undertaken
negative
Let 's see , a haunted house , a haunted ship , what 's next ... Ghost Blimp ?
negative
A fragile framework upon which to hang broad , mildly fleshed-out characters that seem to have been conjured up only 10 minutes prior to filming .
negative
By the time the plot grinds itself out in increasingly incoherent fashion , you might be wishing for a watch that makes time go faster rather than the other way around .
negative
Wes Craven 's presence is felt ; not the Craven of ' A Nightmare on Elm Street ' or ` The Hills Have Eyes , ' but the sad schlock merchant of ` Deadly Friend . '
negative
But the cinematography is cloudy , the picture making becalmed .
negative
It 's one long bore .
negative
It gets old quickly .
negative
Watch Barbershop again if you 're in need of a Cube fix -- this is n't worth sitting through .
negative
It 's leaden and predictable , and laughs are lacking .
negative
... a cinematic disaster so inadvertently sidesplitting it 's worth the price of admission for the ridicule factor alone .
negative
Skip this dreck , rent Animal House and go back to the source .
negative
The movie is a desperate miscalculation .
negative
It gives poor Dana Carvey nothing to do that is really funny , and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time .
negative
We just do n't really care too much about this love story .
negative
In that setting , their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting .
negative
The Transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull .
negative
Uzumaki 's interesting social parallel and defiant aesthetic seems a prostituted muse ...
negative
Large budget notwithstanding , the movie is such a blip on the year 's radar screen that it 's tempting just to go with it for the ride .
positive
But this time , the old MIB label stands for Milder Is n't Better .
negative
Feels familiar and tired .
negative
A retread of material already thoroughly plumbed by Martin Scorsese .
negative
Instead of making his own style , director Marcus Adams just copies from various sources -- good sources , bad mixture
negative
Criminal conspiracies and true romances move so easily across racial and cultural lines in the film that it makes My Big Fat Greek Wedding look like an apartheid drama .
positive
A bore that tends to hammer home every one of its points .
negative
A story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material .
negative
It 's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as The Country Bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at Disneyland .
negative
Starts as an intense political and psychological thriller but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other Hollywood-action cliches .
negative
Completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that I 'm not sure could be a single iota worse ... a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage .
negative
An uneven look into a grim future that does n't come close to the level of intelligence and visual splendour that can be seen in other films based on Philip K. Dick stories .
negative
Horrible .
negative
The disjointed mess flows as naturally as Jolie 's hideous yellow ` do .
negative
Bolstered by an astonishing voice cast ( excepting Love Hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that I have n't encountered since at least Pete 's Dragon .
positive
An authentically vague , but ultimately purposeless , study in total pandemonium .
negative
Makes a joke out of car chases for an hour and then gives us half an hour of car chases .
negative
As the sulking , moody male hustler in the title role , ( Franco ) has all of Dean 's mannerisms and self-indulgence , but none of his sweetness and vulnerability .
negative
The only thing to fear about `` Fear Dot Com '' is hitting your head on the theater seat in front of you when you doze off thirty minutes into the film .
negative
It 's too interested in jerking off in all its Byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience .
negative
` Synthetic ' is the best description of this well-meaning , beautifully produced film that sacrifices its promise for a high-powered star pedigree .
negative
It concentrates far too much on the awkward interplay and utter lack of chemistry between Chan and Hewitt .
negative
Impostor ca n't think of a thing to do with these characters except have them run through dark tunnels , fight off various anonymous attackers , and evade elaborate surveillance technologies .
negative
Judd 's characters ought to pick up the durable best seller Smart Women , Foolish Choices for advice .
negative
The script has less spice than a rat burger and The Rock 's fighting skills are more in line with Steven Seagal .
negative
This ill-conceived and expensive project winds up looking like a bunch of talented thesps slumming it .
negative
... there 's a choppy , surface-effect feeling to the whole enterprise .
negative
Does n't get the job done , running off the limited chemistry created by Ralph Fiennes and Jennifer Lopez .
negative
A particularly joyless , and exceedingly dull , period coming-of-age tale .
negative
It 's impossible to indulge the fanciful daydreams of Janice Beard ( Eileen Walsh ) when her real-life persona is so charmless and vacant .
negative
... it was n't the subject matter that ultimately defeated the film ... It was the unfulfilling , incongruous , `` wait a second , did I miss something ? ''
negative
This is a movie where the most notable observation is how long you 've been sitting still .
negative
Poor editing , bad bluescreen , and ultra-cheesy dialogue highlight the radical action .
negative
It 's super - violent , super-serious and super-stupid .
negative
Just a string of stale gags , with no good inside dope , and no particular bite .
negative
It 's Splash without the jokes .
negative
The Château would have been benefited from a sharper , cleaner script before it went in front of the camera .
negative
Shallow , noisy and pretentious .
negative
Morrissette has performed a difficult task indeed - he 's taken one of the world 's most fascinating stories and made it dull , lifeless , and irritating .
negative
This loud and thoroughly obnoxious comedy about a pair of squabbling working-class spouses is a deeply unpleasant experience .
negative
It 's better than The Phantom Menace .
positive
But unless you 're an absolute raving Star Wars junkie , it is n't much fun .
negative
Philosophically , intellectually and logistically a mess .
negative
A standard police-oriented drama that , were it not for De Niro 's participation , would have likely wound up a TNT Original .
negative
Coupling disgracefully written dialogue with flailing bodily movements that substitute for acting , Circuit is the awkwardly paced soap opera-ish story .
negative
Hollywood Ending just is n't very funny .
negative
Though clearly well-intentioned , this cross-cultural soap opera is painfully formulaic and stilted .
negative
A technical triumph and an extraordinary bore .
negative
I can easily imagine Benigni 's Pinocchio becoming a Christmas perennial .
positive
Coal is n't as easy to come by as it used to be and this would be a worthy substitute for naughty children 's stockings .
negative
Two hours of junk .
negative
A clumsily manufactured exploitation flick , a style-free exercise in manipulation and mayhem .
negative
The whole affair , true story or not , feels incredibly hokey ... ( it ) comes off like a Hallmark commercial .
negative
What 's missing is what we call the ` wow ' factor .
negative
The nicest thing that can be said about Stealing Harvard ( which might have been called Freddy Gets Molested by a Dog ) is that it 's not as obnoxious as Tom Green 's Freddie Got Fingered .
negative
... Tara Reid plays a college journalist , but she looks like the six-time winner of the Miss Hawaiian Tropic Pageant , so I do n't know what she 's doing in here ...
negative
The young stars are too cute ; the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative ; the message is too blatant ; the resolutions are too convenient .
negative
Normally , Rohmer 's talky films fascinate me , but when he moves his setting to the past , and relies on a historical text , he loses the richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable .
negative
It 's been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since I last walked out on a movie , but Resident Evil really earned my indignant , preemptive departure .
negative
This picture is mostly a lump of run-of-the-mill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a probation officer .
negative
But the movie 's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure .
negative
Though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen The Hunger or Cat People will find little new here , but a tasty performance from Vincent Gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary .
positive
A Blair Witch - style adventure that plays like a bad soap opera , with passable performances from everyone in the cast .
negative
Diaz wears out her welcome in her most charmless performance
negative
It is too bad that this likable movie is n't more accomplished .
negative
The actors try hard but come off too amateurish and awkward .
negative
The plot has a number of holes , and at times it 's simply baffling .
negative
An ill-conceived jumble that 's not scary , not smart and not engaging .
negative
Brainless , but enjoyably over-the-top , the retro gang melodrama , Deuces Wild represents fifties teen-gang machismo in a way that borders on rough-trade homo-eroticism .
negative
Gets bogged down by an overly sillified plot and stop-and-start pacing .
negative
Like coming into a long-running , well-written television series where you 've missed the first half-dozen episodes and probably wo n't see the next six .
negative
Its generic villains lack any intrigue ( other than their funny accents ) and the action scenes are poorly delivered .
negative
Dripping with cliche and bypassing no opportunity to trivialize the material .
negative
Hard-core slasher aficionados will find things to like ... but overall the Halloween series has lost its edge .
negative
Stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed .
negative
The story the movie tells is of Brian De Palma 's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career .
negative
With tiny little jokes and nary an original idea , this sappy ethnic sleeper proves that not only blockbusters pollute the summer movie pool .
negative
It sticks rigidly to the paradigm , rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived , well-worn situations .
negative
Ever see one of those comedies that just seem like a bad idea from frame one ?
negative
Once Ice-T sticks his mug in the window of the couple 's BMW and begins haranguing the wife in bad stage dialogue , all credibility flies out the window .

Quitting , however , manages just to be depressing , as the lead actor phones in his autobiographical performance .
negative
It would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi .

For most movies , 84 minutes is short , but this one feels like a life sentence .

Shatner is probably the funniest person in the film , which gives you an idea just how bad it was .

Tries so hard to be quirky and funny that the strain is all too evident .
negative
As immaculate as Stuart Little 2 is , it could be a lot better if it were , well , more adventurous .
positive
Simply a re-hash of the other seven films .
negative
With jump cuts , fast editing and lots of pyrotechnics , Yu clearly hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is .

He fails .

A very depressing movie of many missed opportunities .

Goes on and on to the point of nausea .
negative
By turns numbingly dull-witted and disquietingly creepy .
negative
Boy , has this franchise ever run out of gas .
negative
One problem with the movie , directed by Joel Schumacher , is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time .
negative
The comedy is nonexistent .
negative

It 's a pedestrian , flat drama that screams out ` amateur ' in almost every frame .
negative
A bland animated sequel that hardly seems worth the effort .
negative
It 's not just the vampires that are damned in Queen of the Damned -- the viewers will feel they suffer the same fate .
negative
If religious films are n't your bailiwick , stay away .
negative
Otherwise , this could be a passable date film .
negative
This is the case of a pregnant premise being wasted by a script that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience .
negative
Stuffy , full of itself , morally ambiguous and nothing to shout about .
negative
It is most of the things Costner movies are known for ; it 's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it .
negative
Do n't let the subtitles fool you ; the movie only proves that Hollywood no longer has a monopoly on mindless action .
negative
Chai 's structure and pacing are disconcertingly slack .
negative
To be oblivious to the existence of this film would be very sweet indeed .
negative
The director , with his fake backdrops and stately pacing , never settles on a consistent tone .
negative
Instead of panoramic sweep , Kapur gives us episodic choppiness , undermining the story 's emotional thrust .
negative
The director seems to take an unseemly pleasure in ( the characters ' ) misery and at the same time to congratulate himself for having the guts to confront it .
negative
This dubious product of a college-spawned ( Colgate U. ) comedy ensemble known as Broken Lizard plays like a mix of Cheech and Chong and CHiPs .
negative
The movie does n't think much of its characters , its protagonist , or of us .
negative
After seeing the film , I can tell you that there 's no other reason why anyone should bother remembering it .
negative
As a kind of colorful , dramatized PBS program , Frida gets the job done .
positive
With minimal imagination , you could restage the whole thing in your bathtub .
negative
Nights feels more like a quickie TV special than a feature film ... It 's not even a TV special you 'd bother watching past the second commercial break .
negative
Although ... visually striking and slickly staged , it 's also cold , grey , antiseptic and emotionally desiccated .
negative
Friday After Next is the kind of film that could only be made by African-Americans because of its broad racial insensitivity towards African-Americans .
negative
It 's not as awful as some of the recent Hollywood trip tripe ... but it 's far from a groundbreaking endeavor .
negative
The only thing `` swept away '' is the one hour and thirty-three minutes spent watching this waste of time .

negative
Even the hastily and amateurishly drawn animation can not engage .
negative
Kung Pow is Oedekerk 's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that .
negative
Busy urban comedy is clearly not Zhang 's forte , his directorial touch is neither light nor magical enough to bring off this kind of whimsy .
negative
Not completely loveable -- but what underdog movie since The Bad News Bears has been ?
negative
-- but certainly hard to hate .
positive
A movie that ca n't get sufficient distance from Leroy 's delusions to escape their maudlin influence .
negative
- greaseballs mob action-comedy .
negative
Louiso lets the movie dawdle in classic disaffected-indie-film mode , and brother Hoffman 's script stumbles over a late-inning twist that just does n't make sense .
negative
The movie straddles the fence between escapism and social commentary , and on both sides it falls short .
negative
The film is old-fashioned , occasionally charming and as subtle as boldface .
positive
Try this obscenely bad dark comedy , so crass that it makes Edward Burns ' Sidewalks of New York look like Oscar Wilde .
negative
In The New Guy , even the bull gets recycled .
negative
On top of a foundering performance , ( Madonna 's ) denied her own athleticism by lighting that emphasizes every line and sag .
negative
He 's not good with people .
negative
Patchy combination of soap opera , low-tech magic realism and , at times , ploddingly sociological commentary .
negative
( Stevens is ) so stoked to make an important film about human infidelity and happenstance that he tosses a kitchen sink onto a story already overladen with plot conceits .
negative
So boring that even its target audience talked all the way through it .
negative
One of the more glaring signs of this movie 's servitude to its superstar is the way it skirts around any scenes that might have required genuine acting from Ms. Spears .
negative
Hollywood Ending is the most disappointing Woody Allen movie ever .
negative
He has a great cast and a great idea .
positive
It 's just hard to believe that a life like this can sound so dull .

An overstylized , puréed mélange of sex , psychology , drugs and philosophy .
negative
Ringu is a disaster of a story , full of holes and completely lacking in chills .
negative
Ignore the reputation , and ignore the film .

This one is a few bits funnier than Malle 's dud , if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like Slob City reductions of Damon Runyon crooks .
positive
` It 's painful to watch Witherspoon 's talents wasting away inside unnecessary films like Legally Blonde and Sweet Home Abomination , I mean , Alabama . '
negative
A plodding teen remake that 's so mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot twists .
negative
Trying to figure out the rules of the Country Bear universe -- when are bears bears and when are they like humans , only hairier -- would tax Einstein 's brain .
negative
Even in terms of the low-grade cheese standards on which it operates , it never quite makes the grade as tawdry trash .

Amidst the action , the script carries Arnold ( and the viewers ) into the forbidden zone of sympathizing with terrorist motivations by presenting the `` other side of the story . ''

Too intensely focused on the travails of being Hal Hartley to function as pastiche , No Such Thing is Hartley 's least accessible screed yet .

Director Uwe Boll and writer Robert Dean Klein fail to generate any interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out , can not overcome blah characters .

A clichéd and shallow cautionary tale about the hard-partying lives of gay men .
negative
The fetid underbelly of fame has never looked uglier .
negative
A little weak -- and it is n't that funny .

The script boasts some tart TV-insider humor , but the film has not a trace of humanity or empathy .

The original was n't a good movie but this remake makes it look like a masterpiece !
negative
One suspects that Craven endorses They simply because this movie makes his own look much better by comparison .
negative
Includes too much obvious padding .
negative
There 's no palpable chemistry between Lopez and male lead Ralph Fiennes , plus the script by Working Girl scribe Kevin Wade is workmanlike in the extreme .
negative
I 'm not sure which half of Dragonfly is worse : The part where nothing 's happening , or the part where something 's happening , but it 's stupid .
negative
The only camouflage Carvey should now be considering is a paper bag to wear over his head when he goes out into public , to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers .

Shot like a postcard and overacted with all the boozy self-indulgence that brings out the worst in otherwise talented actors ...
negative
Spain 's greatest star wattage does n't overcome the tumult of maudlin tragedy .

Looks and feels like a low-budget hybrid of Scarface or Carlito 's Way .
negative
The script is a tired one , with few moments of joy rising above the stale material .
negative
Suffers from all the excesses of the genre .
negative
The verdict : Two bodies and hardly a laugh between them .
negative
The latest Adam Sandler assault and possibly the worst film of the year .
negative
Downbeat , period-perfect biopic hammers home a heavy-handed moralistic message .
positive
While the film is competent , it 's also uninspired , lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires .
negative
They ought to be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering .
negative
But it 's hard to imagine a more generic effort in the genre .
negative
It 's just plain lurid when it is n't downright silly .
negative
Pap invested in undergraduate doubling subtexts and ridiculous stabs at existentialism reminding of the discovery of the wizard of God in the fifth Trek flick .
negative
A horror movie with seriously dumb characters , which somewhat dilutes the pleasure of watching them stalked by creepy-crawly bug things that live only in the darkness .
negative
It 's a film with an idea buried somewhere inside its fabric , but never clearly seen or felt .
negative
A movie in which two not very absorbing characters are engaged in a romance you ca n't wait to see end .
negative
The predominantly amateur cast is painful to watch , so stilted and unconvincing are the performances .
negative
They 're the unnamed , easily substitutable forces that serve as whatever terror the heroes of horror movies try to avoid .

Elegantly crafted but emotionally cold , a puzzle whose intricate construction one can admire but is difficult to connect with on any deeper level .

Were Dylan Thomas alive to witness first-time director Ethan Hawke 's strained Chelsea Walls , he might have been tempted to change his landmark poem to , ` Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Theatre . '

The story has its redundancies , and the young actors , not very experienced , are sometimes inexpressive .
negative
I 'm sure the filmmaker would disagree , but , honestly , I do n't see the point .
negative
It 's a visual Rorschach test and I must have failed .
negative
The film is really closer to porn than a serious critique of what 's wrong with this increasingly pervasive aspect of gay culture .
negative
Murder by Numbers just does n't add up .
negative
Clare Peploe 's airless movie adaptation could use a little American Pie-like irreverence .
negative
Video games are more involving than this mess .

A pale Xerox of other , better crime movies .

negative
Illiterate , often inert sci-fi action thriller .

A perfect example of rancid , well-intentioned , but shamelessly manipulative movie making .

The adventure does n't contain half the excitement of Balto , or quarter the fun of Toy Story 2 .
negative
Essentially a collection of bits -- and they 're all naughty .
positive
A mess .
negative
The screenplay does too much meandering , Norton has to recite bland police procedural details , Fiennes wanders around in an attempt to seem weird and distanced , Hopkins looks like a drag queen .
negative
The screenplay by James Eric , James Horton and director Peter O'Fallon ... is so pat it makes your teeth hurt .
negative
Before it takes a sudden turn and devolves into a bizarre sort of romantic comedy , Steven Shainberg 's adaptation of Mary Gaitskill 's harrowing short story ... is a brilliantly played , deeply unsettling experience .
positive
Solaris is rigid and evasive in ways that Soderbergh 's best films , `` Erin Brockovich , '' `` Out of Sight '' and `` Ocean 's Eleven , '' never were .
positive
Seems like something American and European gay movies were doing 20 years ago .
negative
In the process of trimming the movie to an expeditious 84 minutes , director Roger Kumble seems to have dumped a whole lot of plot in favor of ... outrageous gags .
negative
Thumbs down .
negative
The characters are paper thin and the plot is so cliched and contrived that it makes your least favorite James Bond movie seem as cleverly plotted as The Usual Suspects .
negative
... del Toro maintains a dark mood that makes the film seem like something to endure instead of enjoy .
negative
The movie eventually snaps under the strain of its plot contrivances and its need to reassure .
negative
Now here 's a sadistic bike flick that would have made Vittorio De Sica proud .
positive
A movie that 's about as overbearing and over-the-top as the family it depicts .
negative
A movie in which laughter and self-exploitation merge into jolly soft-porn 'em powerment . '
positive
If we 're to slap protagonist Genevieve LePlouff because she 's French , do we have that same option to slap her creators because they 're clueless and inept ?
negative
Too predictably , in fact .
negative
Alternative medicine obviously has its merits ... but Ayurveda does the field no favors .
negative
This thing works on no level whatsoever for me .
negative
An incoherent jumble of a film that 's rarely as entertaining as it could have been .
negative
More dutiful than enchanting ... terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat .
negative
Laconic and very stilted in its dialogue , this indie flick never found its audience , probably because it 's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters .
negative
The comedy Death to Smoochy is a rancorous curiosity : a movie without an apparent audience .
negative
Barney 's ideas about creation and identity do n't really seem all that profound , at least by way of what can be gleaned from this three-hour endurance test built around an hour 's worth of actual material .
negative
Cinematic pyrotechnics aside , the only thing Avary seems to care about are mean giggles and pulchritude .
negative
Nothing more or less than an outright bodice-ripper -- it should have ditched the artsy pretensions and revelled in the entertaining shallows .
negative
A living testament to the power of the eccentric and the strange .
positive
The fact that it is n't very good is almost beside the point .
negative
Feels less like a cousin to Blade Runner than like a bottom-feeder sequel in the Escape From New York series .
negative
What might have been acceptable on the printed page of Iles ' book does not translate well to the screen .
negative
If Oscar had a category called Best Bad Film You Thought Was Going To Be Really Awful But Was n't , Guys would probably be duking it out with The Queen of the Damned for the honor .

A poky and pseudo-serious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise .
negative
Mediocre fable from Burkina Faso .
negative
Fessenden has nurtured his metaphors at the expense of his narrative , but he does display an original talent .
positive
Bottom-rung New Jack City wannabe .

Fincher takes no apparent joy in making movies , and he gives none to the audience .

It 's mildly amusing , but I certainly ca n't recommend it .

Nicholas Nickleby celebrates the human spirit with such unrelenting Dickensian decency that it turned me ( horrors ! )

Fear Dot Com is more frustrating than a modem that disconnects every 10 seconds .
negative
Full of flatulence jokes and mild sexual references , Kung Pow !
negative
is the kind of movie that 's critic-proof , simply because it aims so low .
negative
May cause you to bite your tongue to keep from laughing at the ridiculous dialog or the oh-so convenient plot twists .
negative
There are just too many characters saying too many clever things and getting into too many pointless situations .
negative
Where 's the movie here ?
negative
Lacking substance and soul , Crossroads comes up shorter than Britney 's cutoffs .
negative
Cassavetes thinks he 's making Dog Day Afternoon with a cause , but all he 's done is to reduce everything he touches to a shrill , didactic cartoon .
negative
Buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clichés and borrowed images that it might more accurately be titled Mr. Chips off the Old Block .
negative
Although sensitive to a fault , it 's often overwritten , with a surfeit of weighty revelations , flowery dialogue , and nostalgia for the past and roads not taken .
negative
It 's so badly made on every level that I 'm actually having a hard time believing people were paid to make it .
negative
In the real world , an actor this uncharismatically beautiful would have a résumé loaded with credits like `` Girl in Bar # 3 . ''
negative
... although this idea is `` new '' the results are tired .
negative
I 'm guessing the director is a magician .
positive
After all , he took three minutes of dialogue , 30 seconds of plot and turned them into a 90-minute movie that feels five hours long .
negative
An unencouraging threefold expansion on the former MTV series , accompanying the stunt-hungry dimwits in a random series of collected gags , pranks , pratfalls , dares , injuries , etc. .
negative
In its own way , Joshua is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a Luis Buñuel film without the latter 's attendant intelligence , poetry , passion , and genius .
negative
an appalling ` Ace Ventura ' rip-off that somehow manages to bring together Kevin Pollak , former wrestler Chyna and Dolly Parton .
negative
If any of them list this ` credit ' on their resumes in the future , that 'll be much funnier than anything in the film ...
negative
The only entertainment you 'll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair will be from unintentional giggles -- several of them .
negative
Puportedly `` Based on True Events , '' a convolution of language that suggests it 's impossible to claim that it is `` Based on a True Story '' with a straight face .
negative
... a plotline that 's as lumpy as two-day old porridge ... the filmmakers ' paws , sad to say , were all over this `` un-bear-able '' project !
negative
Tambor and Clayburgh make an appealing couple -- he 's understated and sardonic , she 's appealingly manic and energetic .
positive
Both deserve better .
negative
-- that the ` true story ' by which All the Queen 's Men is allegedly `` inspired '' was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what 's been cobbled together onscreen .
negative
Is there a group of more self-absorbed women than the mother and daughters featured in this film ?
negative
I do n't think so .
negative
Nothing wrong with performances here , but the whiney characters bugged me .
negative
Not a stereotype is omitted nor a cliché left unsaid .
negative
Another week , another gross-out college comedy -- ugh .
negative
A battle between bug-eye theatre and dead-eye matinee .
negative
The movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical .
negative
What 's worse is that Pelosi knows it .
negative
... instead go rent `` Shakes The Clown '' , a much funnier film with a similar theme and an equally great Robin Williams performance .
negative
If the title is a Jeopardy question , then the answer might be `` How does Steven Seagal come across these days ? ''
negative
or maybe `` How will you feel after an 88-minute rip-off of The Rock with action confined to slo-mo gun firing and random glass-shattering ? ''
negative
The appeal of the vulgar , sexist , racist humour went over my head or -- considering just how low brow it is -- perhaps it snuck under my feet .
negative
The story really has no place to go since Simone is not real -- she ca n't provide any conflict .
negative
First-time director João Pedro Rodrigues ' unwillingness to define his hero 's background or motivations becomes more and more frustrating as the film goes on .

`` Interview '' loses its overall sense of mystery and becomes a TV episode rather than a documentary that you actually buy into .
negative
` Unfaithful ' cheats on itself and retreats to comfortable territory .
negative
Too bad .
negative
Thoughtless , random , superficial humour and a lot of very bad Scouse accents
negative
Plays like one of those conversations that Comic Book Guy on `` The Simpsons '' has .
negative
No thanks .
negative
Wewannour money back , actually .
negative
Should n't have been allowed to use the word `` new '' in its title , because there 's not an original character , siuation or joke in the entire movie .
negative
Often silly -- and gross -- but it 's rarely as moronic as some campus gross-out films .

Reign of Fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap .

Lucy 's a dull girl , that 's all .
negative
I admire it and yet can not recommend it , because it overstays its natural running time .
negative
It 's a bad sign when you 're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects ' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it 's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest .
negative
Stephen Earnhart 's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition -- wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text -- when it 's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type .
negative
A semi-autobiographical film that 's so sloppily written and cast that you can not believe anyone more central to the creation of Bugsy than the caterer had anything to do with it .
negative
The movie barely makes sense , with its unbelievable naïveté and arbitrary flashbacks .
negative
Build some robots , haul 'em to the theatre with you for the late show , and put on your own Mystery Science Theatre 3000 tribute to what is almost certainly going to go down as the worst -- and only -- killer website movie of this or any other year .

negative
It 's tough to tell which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie , directed by Scott Kalvert , about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 Brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo .
negative
Gooding and Coburn are both Oscar winners , a fact which , as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through Snow Dogs , seems inconceivable .
negative
At every opportunity to do something clever , the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability ... all you have left is a no-surprise series of explosions and violence while Banderas looks like he 's not trying to laugh at how bad it
negative
... pitiful , slapdash disaster .
negative
A DOA dud from frame one .
negative
Jaw-droppingly superficial , straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as John Ritter 's glory days on Three 's Company .

Godard uses his characters -- if that 's not too glorified a term -- as art things , mouthpieces , visual motifs , blanks .
negative
The movie generates plot points with a degree of randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing .

A predictable , manipulative stinker .
negative
The story passes time until it 's time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge .
negative
It 's a spectacular performance - ahem , we hope it 's only acting .
positive
The movie suffers from two fatal ailments -- a dearth of vitality and a story that 's shapeless and uninflected .
negative
It 's just weirdness for the sake of weirdness , and where Human Nature should be ingratiating , it 's just grating .
negative
An ambitiously naturalistic , albeit half-baked , drama about an abused , inner-city autistic teen .
positive
once she lets her love depraved leads meet , ( Denis ' ) story becomes a hopeless , unsatisfying muddle
negative
What 's really sad is to see two Academy Award winning actresses ( and one Academy Award winning actor ) succumb to appearing in this junk that 's TV sitcom material at best .

No doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place .
positive
Where their heads were is anyone 's guess .
negative
Call me a cynic , but there 's something awfully deadly about any movie with a life-affirming message .
negative
A gratingly unfunny groaner littered with zero-dimensional , unlikable characters and hackneyed , threadbare comic setups .
negative
Got some good , organic character work , lots of obvious political insights and little room for engaging , imaginative filmmaking in its nearly 2 1/2 - hour , dissipated length .
positive
A painfully slow cliche-ridden film filled with more holes than Clyde Barrow 's car .
negative
Like leafing through an album of photos accompanied by the sketchiest of captions .
negative
I guess it just goes to show that if you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood , nothing good can happen .
negative
Gaghan captures the half-lit , sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms , a subtlety that makes the silly , over-the-top coda especially disappointing .
negative
Feels less like a change in ( Herzog 's ) personal policy than a half-hearted fluke .
negative
One of the most unpleasant things the studio has ever produced .
negative
Will anyone who is n't a Fangoria subscriber be excited that it has n't gone straight to video ?
negative
A selection of scenes in search of a movie .
negative
( Janey ) forgets about her other obligations , leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies .
negative
Will undoubtedly play well in European markets , where Mr. Besson is a brand name , and in Asia , where Ms. Shu is an institution , but American audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic .
negative
True to its animatronic roots : ... as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus ... ` The Country Bears ' should never have been brought out of hibernation .
negative
( Evans is ) a fascinating character , and deserves a better vehicle than this facetious smirk of a movie .
negative
The script 's judgment and sense of weight is way , way off .
negative
Evelyn may be based on a true and historically significant story , but the filmmakers have made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter 's invention .

A derivative collection of horror and sci-fi cliches .

Loosely speaking , we 're in All of Me territory again , and , strictly speaking , Schneider is no Steve Martin .
negative
As aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice , the movie makes two hours feel like four .
negative
Limps along on a squirm-inducing fish-out-of-water formula that goes nowhere and goes there very , very slowly .
negative
Just the sort of lazy tearjerker that gives movies about ordinary folk a bad name .
negative
The redeeming feature of Chan 's films has always been the action , but the stunts in The Tuxedo seem tired and , what 's worse , routine .
negative
While The Importance of Being Earnest offers opportunities for occasional smiles and chuckles , it does n't give us a reason to be in the theater beyond Wilde 's wit and the actors ' performances .
negative
Has all the scenic appeal of a cesspool .
negative
A rambling ensemble piece with loosely connected characters and plots that never quite gel .
negative
It 's hard to say who might enjoy this , are there Tolstoy groupies out there ?
negative
This is a movie that starts out like Heathers , then becomes Bring it On , then becomes unwatchable .
negative
The screenplay flounders under the weight of too many story lines .
negative
I think it was Plato who said , ' I think , therefore I know better than to rush to the theatre for this one . '
negative
If Damon and Affleck attempt another Project Greenlight , next time out they might try paying less attention to the miniseries and more attention to the film it is about .
negative
This is rote drivel aimed at Mom and Dad 's wallet .
negative
Contrived , maudlin and cliche-ridden ... if this sappy script was the best the contest received , those rejected must have been astronomically bad .
negative
I hate the feeling of having been slimed in the name of High Art .
negative
The kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored , cheering the pratfalls but little else ; their parents , wise folks that they are , read books .
negative
Whether Jason X is this bad on purpose is never clear .
negative
But one thing 's for sure : It never comes close to being either funny or scary .
negative
I like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material , but they 're treading water at best in this forgettable effort .
positive
is that it 's a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime .
negative
This insufferable movie is meant to make you think about existential suffering .
negative
Instead , it 'll only put you to sleep .
negative
It 's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are ` edgy . '
negative
A sleep-inducingly slow-paced crime drama with clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment , and an overly-familiar set of plot devices .
negative
It 's so tedious that it makes you forgive every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in Bridget Jones 's Diary .
negative
Almost as offensive as `` Freddy Got Fingered . ''
negative
The gifted Crudup has the perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself , and his cipherlike personality and bad behavior would play fine if the movie knew what to do with him .
negative
It is depressing , ruthlessly pained and depraved , the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound .
negative
Ponderous , plodding soap opera disguised as a feature film .
negative
Cold , pretentious , thoroughly dislikable study in sociopathy .
negative
For the future , one hopes Mr. Plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter .
negative
A cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at Revolution Studios and Imagine Entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender $ 9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life .
negative
Reign of Fire never comes close to recovering from its demented premise , but it does sustain an enjoyable level of ridiculousness .
negative
Human Nature is a goofball movie , in the way that Malkovich was , but it tries too hard .
positive
Originality is sorely lacking .
negative
But while the highly predictable narrative falls short , Treasure Planet is truly gorgeous to behold .
positive
Though there are entertaining and audacious moments , the movie 's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker 's flailing reputation .
negative
For a story set at sea , Ghost Ship is pretty landbound , with its leaden acting , dull exposition and telegraphed ` surprises . '
negative
There might be some sort of credible gender-provoking philosophy submerged here , but who the hell cares ?
negative
Nothing more than a stifling morality tale dressed up in peekaboo clothing .
negative
I like my Christmas movies with more elves and snow and less pimps and ho 's .
negative
It all seemed wasted like DeNiro 's once promising career and the once grand Long Beach boardwalk .
negative
( I ) t 's certainly laudable that the movie deals with hot-button issues in a comedic context , but Barbershop is n't as funny as it should be .
negative
Unfortunately , a cast of competent performers from movies , television and the theater are cast adrift in various New York City locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style .
negative
Equilibrium the movie , as opposed to the manifesto , is really , really stupid .
negative
Excruciatingly unfunny and pitifully unromantic .
negative
The film 's thoroughly recycled plot and tiresome jokes ... drag the movie down .
negative
It does n't offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is , or even its attitude toward its subject .
negative
This kiddie-oriented stinker is so bad that I even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater
negative
Though Impostor deviously adopts the guise of a modern motion picture , it too is a bomb .
negative
Cox offers plenty of glimpses at existing photos , but there are no movies of Nijinsky , so instead the director treats us to an aimless hodgepodge .
negative
Every note rings false .
negative
When the screenwriter responsible for one of the worst movies of one year directs an equally miserable film the following year , you 'd have a hard time believing it was just coincidence .
negative
It never rises to its clever what-if concept .
negative
This story of unrequited love does n't sustain interest beyond the first half-hour .
negative
This angst-ridden territory was covered earlier and much better in Ordinary People .
negative
The entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another .
negative
About half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal .
negative
A big , loud , bang-the-drum bore .
negative
( Less a movie than ) an appalling , odoriferous thing ... so rotten in almost every single facet of production that you 'll want to crawl up your own *** in embarrassment .
negative
The concept behind Kung Pow : Enter the Fist is hilarious .
positive
El Crimen Del Padre Amaro would likely be most effective if used as a tool to rally anti-Catholic protestors .
negative
Interesting and thoroughly unfaithful version of Carmen
positive
A serious movie with serious ideas .
positive
But seriously , folks , it does n't work .
negative
There 's nothing exactly wrong here , but there 's not nearly enough that 's right .
negative
The action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises .
negative
I could n't help but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy .
negative
What Madonna does here ca n't properly be called acting -- more accurately , it 's moving and it 's talking and it 's occasionally gesturing , sometimes all at once .
negative
( A ) painfully flat gross-out comedy ...
negative
Even if you 're an Elvis person , you wo n't find anything to get excited about on this DVD .
negative
It 's bedeviled by labored writing and slack direction .
negative
I 'm sure there 's a teenage boy out there somewhere who 's dying for this kind of entertainment .
negative
The Tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life .
negative
The film is a confusing melange of tones and styles , one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama .
negative
Obviously , a lot of people wasted a lot of their time ( including mine ) on something very inconsequential .
negative
There 's a little violence and lots of sex in a bid to hold our attention , but it grows monotonous after a while , as do Joan and Philip 's repetitive arguments , schemes and treachery .
negative
It drowns in sap .
negative
Deliberately and devotedly constructed , Far from Heaven is too picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pin-like , too obviously a recreation to resonate .
positive
It 's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline ; everything that 's good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that 's just too boring and obvious .
negative
I 'm giving it thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment .
negative
There 's got to be a more graceful way of portraying the devastation of this disease .
negative
The modern-day characters are nowhere near as vivid as the 19th-century ones .
negative
Blessed with a searing lead performance by Ryan Gosling ( Murder by Numbers ) , the movie is powerful and provocative .
positive
It 's also built on a faulty premise , one it follows into melodrama and silliness .
negative
Uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire that has no teeth .
negative
Director Jay Russell stomps in hobnail boots over Natalie Babbitt 's gentle , endearing 1975 children 's novel .
negative
The troubling thing about Clockstoppers is that it does n't make any sense .
negative
With its paint fights , motorized scooter chases and dewy-eyed sentiment , it 's a pretty listless collection of kid-movie clichés .
negative
Kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper .
negative
A rote exercise in both animation and storytelling .
negative
The material and the production itself are little more than routine .
negative
The movie 's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it 's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had .
negative
Not even Steven Spielberg has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie .
negative
It 's all surface psychodramatics .
negative
The Mothman Prophecies , which is mostly a bore , seems to exist only for its climactic setpiece .
negative
That frenetic spectacle ( on the TV show ) has usually been leavened by a charm that 's conspicuously missing from the Girls ' big-screen blowout .
negative
Kitschy , flashy , overlong soap opera .
negative
For all the time we spend with these people , we never really get inside of them .
negative
Yet another Arnold vehicle that fails to make adequate use of his particular talents .
negative
Sandra Bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ai n't - she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff .
negative
An undistinguished attempt to make a classic theater piece cinematic .
negative
too many scenarios in which the hero might have an opportunity to triumphantly sermonize , and too few that allow us to wonder for ourselves if things will turn out okay .
negative
There is simply not enough of interest onscreen to sustain its seventy-minute running time .
negative
Broomfield 's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient .
negative
( Seagal 's ) strenuous attempt at a change in expression could very well clinch him this year 's Razzie .
negative
Has the disjointed feel of a bunch of strung-together TV episodes .
negative
A series of escapades demonstrating the adage that what is good for the goose is also good for the gander , some of which occasionally amuses but none of which amounts to much of a story .
negative
Ozpetek offers an AIDS subtext , skims over the realities of gay sex , and presents yet another tired old vision of the gay community as an all-inclusive world where uptight , middle class bores like Antonia can feel good about themselves .
negative
The Sweetest Thing is expressly for idiots who do n't care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance .
negative
Sinks so low in a poorly played game of absurd plot twists , idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters that even Freeman ca n't save it .
negative
It made me realize that we really have n't had a good cheesy B-movie playing in theaters since ... well ... since last week 's Reign of Fire .
negative
Some movies were made for the big screen , some for the small screen , and some , like Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever , were made for the palm screen .
negative
SC2 is an autopilot Hollywood concoction lacking in imagination and authentic Christmas spirit , yet it 's geared toward an audience full of masters of both .
negative
Seems content to dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool , and it 's a sad , sick sight .
negative
It 's refreshing that someone understands the need for the bad boy ; Diesel , with his brawny frame and cool , composed delivery , fits the bill perfectly .
positive
Suffers from a flat script and a low budget .
negative
There are deeply religious and spiritual people in this world who would argue that entering a church , synagogue or temple does n't mean you have to check your brain at the door .
positive
Seemingly a vehicle to showcase the Canadian 's inane ramblings , Stealing Harvard is a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former Mr. Drew Barrymore .
negative
This franchise has not spawned a single good film .
negative
The crap continues .
negative
Its inescapable absurdities are tantamount to insulting the intelligence of anyone who has n't been living under a rock ( since Sept. 11 ) .
negative
High drama , Disney-style - a wing and a prayer and a hunky has-been pursuing his castle in the sky .
positive
Like its script , which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire Olympic swim team through , the characters in Swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull , brain-deadening hangover .
negative
One big blustery movie where nothing really happens .
negative
When it comes out on video , then it 's the perfect cure for insomnia .
negative
Like a comedian who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop , Comedian runs out of steam after a half hour .
negative
The pairing does sound promising in theory ... but their lack of chemistry makes Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro in Showtime look like old , familiar vaudeville partners .
negative
I could just feel the screenwriter at every moment ` Tap , tap , tap , tap , tapping away ' on this screenplay .
negative
A stupid , derivative horror film that substitutes extreme gore for suspense .
negative
The rollerball sequences feel sanitised and stagey .
negative
Roman Polanski directs The Pianist like a surgeon mends a broken heart ; very meticulously but without any passion .
negative
This is an action movie with an action icon who 's been all but decommissioned .
negative
Even if it is generally amusing from time to time , I Spy has all the same problems the majority of action comedies have .
negative
Much like Robin Williams , Death to Smoochy has already reached its expiration date .
negative
An annoying orgy of excess and exploitation that has no point and goes nowhere .
negative
A tired , unnecessary retread ... a stale copy of a picture that was n't all that great to begin with .
negative
A worthy idea , but the uninspired scripts , acting and direction never rise above the level of an after-school TV special .
negative
Ear-splitting exercise in formula crash-and-bash action .
negative
The emotional overload of female angst irreparably drags the film down .
negative
Schaefer 's ... determination to inject farcical raunch ... drowns out the promise of the romantic angle .
negative
Like Showgirls and Glitter , the most entertaining moments here are unintentional .
negative
While some of the camera work is interesting , the film 's mid-to-low budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work .
negative
It 's in the action scenes that things fall apart .
negative
Impostor is a step down for director Gary Fleder .
negative
Seagal , who looks more like Danny Aiello these days , mumbles his way through the movie .
negative
The movie is a negligible work of manipulation , an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents .
negative
Lacks dramatic punch and depth .
negative
I can analyze this movie in three words : Thumbs Friggin ' Down .
negative
Sadly , ` Garth ' has n't progressed as nicely as ` Wayne . '
negative
Make like the title and dodge this one .
negative
This is not one of the movies you 'd want to watch if you only had a week to live .
negative
The first hour is tedious though Ford and Neeson capably hold our interest , but its just not a thrilling movie .
negative
Here 's a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior .
negative
( Green is ) the comedy equivalent of Saddam Hussein , and I 'm just about ready to go to the U.N. and ask permission for a preemptive strike .
negative
No amount of good acting is enough to save Oleander 's uninspired story .
negative
A vile , incoherent mess ... a scummy ripoff of David Cronenberg 's brilliant ` Videodrome . '
negative
Murphy and Wilson actually make a pretty good team ... but the project surrounding them is distressingly rote .
negative
Think The Lion King redone for horses , with fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite songs by Bryan Adams , the world 's most generic rock star .
negative
A small fortune in salaries and stunt cars might have been saved if the director , Tom Dey , had spliced together bits and pieces of Midnight Run and 48 Hours ( and , for that matter , Shrek ) .
negative
An amateurish , quasi-improvised acting exercise shot on ugly digital video .
negative
The holes in this film remain agape -- holes punched through by an inconsistent , meandering , and sometimes dry plot .
negative
Would Benigni 's Italian Pinocchio have been any easier to sit through than this hastily dubbed disaster ?
negative
Officially , it is twice as bestial but half as funny .
negative
This is a fragmented film , once a good idea that was followed by the bad idea to turn it into a movie .
negative
Mindless yet impressively lean spinoff of last summer 's bloated effects fest The Mummy Returns .
positive
Halfway through the movie , the humor dwindles .
negative
It 's replaced by some dramatic scenes that are jarring and deeply out of place in what could have ( and probably should have ) been a lighthearted comedy .
negative
Control-Alt-Delete Simone as quickly as possible
negative
Follows the original film virtually scene for scene and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun .
negative
Has lost some of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies ...
negative
Vaguely interesting , but it 's just too too much .
negative
... no charm , no laughs , no fun , no reason to watch .
negative
A generic family comedy unlikely to be appreciated by anyone outside the under-10 set .
negative
Kung Pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after Oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party .
negative
Kurys seems intimidated by both her subject matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business .
negative
A manipulative feminist empowerment tale thinly posing as a serious drama about spousal abuse .
negative
Everything in Maid in Manhattan is exceedingly pleasant , designed not to offend .
positive
It goes down easy , leaving virtually no aftertaste .
positive
A profoundly stupid affair , populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility .
negative
... pays tribute to heroes the way Julia Roberts hands out awards -- with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism .
negative
Time stands still in more ways that one in Clockstoppers , a sci-fi thriller as lazy as it is interminable .
negative
As a director , Eastwood is off his game -- there 's no real sense of suspense , and none of the plot ` surprises ' are really surprising .
negative
A puzzle whose pieces do not fit .
negative
Would that Greengrass had gone a tad less for grit and a lot more for intelligibility .
negative
` Butterfingered ' is the word for the big-fisted direction of Jez Butterworth , who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach .
negative
Be forewarned , if you 're depressed about anything before watching this film , you may just end up trying to drown yourself in a lake afterwards .
negative
a terrible adaptation of a play that only ever walked the delicate tightrope between farcical and loathsome .
negative
In the wrong hands , i.e. Peploe 's , it 's simply unbearable
negative
An inexperienced director , Mehta has much to learn .
negative
A limp Eddie Murphy vehicle that even he seems embarrassed to be part of .
negative
So muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker 's characteristic style .
negative
A gushy episode of `` M * A * S * H '' only this time from an Asian perspective .
negative
`` Looking For Leonard '' just seems to kinda sit in neutral , hoping for a stiff wind to blow it uphill or something .
negative
Nothing more than four or five mild chuckles surrounded by 86 minutes of overly-familiar and poorly-constructed comedy .
negative
Definitely in the guilty pleasure B-movie category , Reign of Fire is so incredibly inane that it is laughingly enjoyable .
positive
Good-looking but relentlessly lowbrow outing plays like Clueless Does South Fork .
negative
entertaining enough , but nothing new
negative
... one resurrection too many .
negative
This is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout .
negative
Even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life , the mood remains oddly detached .
negative
In spite of featuring a script credited to no fewer than five writers , apparently nobody here bothered to check it twice .
negative
No one involved , save Dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and the script , credited to director Abdul Malik Abbott and Ernest ` Tron ' Anderson , seems entirely improvised .
negative
Initially gripping , eventually cloying POW drama .
positive
A timid , soggy near miss .
negative
Works better in the conception than it does in the execution ... winds up seeming just a little too clever .
negative
To the vast majority of more casual filmgoers , it will probably be a talky bore .
negative
Shunji Iwai 's All About Lily Chou Chou is a beautifully shot , but ultimately flawed film about growing up in Japan .
negative
With more character development this might have been an eerie thriller ; with better payoffs , it could have been a thinking man 's monster movie .
negative
There 's not a single jump-in-your-seat moment and believe it or not , Jason actually takes a backseat in his own film to special effects .
negative
Goldbacher draws on an elegant visual sense and a talent for easy , seductive pacing ... but she and writing partner Laurence Coriat do n't manage an equally assured narrative coinage .
positive
Though Harris is affecting at times , he can not overcome the sense that Pumpkin is a mere plot pawn for two directors with far less endearing disabilities .
negative
The documentary is much too conventional -- lots of boring talking heads , etc. -- to do the subject matter justice .
negative
The movie itself appears to be running on hypertime in reverse as the truly funny bits get further and further apart .
negative
This is not a Jackie Chan movie .
negative
It 's just a movie that happens to have Jackie Chan in it .
negative
And that makes all the difference .
positive
Far too clever by half , Howard 's film is really a series of strung-together moments , with all the spaces in between filled with fantasies , daydreams , memories and one fantastic visual trope after another .
negative
The problem with movies about angels is they have a tendency to slip into hokum .
negative
A Rumor of Angels does n't just slip -- it avalanches into forced fuzziness .
negative
No big whoop , nothing new to see , zero thrills , too many flashbacks and a choppy ending make for a bad film .
negative
I do n't think this movie loves women at all .
negative
Shankman ... and screenwriter Karen Janszen bungle their way through the narrative as if it were a series of Bible parables and not an actual story .
negative
A negligible British comedy .
negative
Fails to convince the audience that these brats will ever be anything more than losers .
negative
Slack and uninspired , and peopled mainly by characters so unsympathetic that you 're left with a sour taste in your mouth .
negative
Skip this turd and pick your nose instead because you 're sure to get more out of the latter experience .
negative
Trailer trash cinema so uncool the only thing missing is the `` Gadzooks ! ''
negative
Her film is like a beautiful food entrée that is n't heated properly , so that it ends up a bit cold and relatively flavorless .
negative
Like the world of his film , Hartley created a monster but did n't know how to handle it .
negative
No new plot conceptions or environmental changes , just different bodies for sharp objects to rip through .
negative
Needs more impressionistic cinematography and exhilarating point-of-view shots and fewer slow-motion ` grandeur ' shots and quick-cut edits that often detract from the athleticism .
negative
In the end , there is n't much to it .
negative
A waste of fearless purity in the acting craft .
negative
The film is ultimately about as inspiring as a Hallmark card .
negative
Anyone not into high-tech splatterfests is advised to take the warning literally , and log on to something more user-friendly .
negative
Disreputable doings and exquisite trappings are dampened by a lackluster script and substandard performances .
negative
You could easily mistake it for a sketchy work-in-progress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time .
negative
Yet another entry in the sentimental oh-those-wacky-Brits genre that was ushered in by The Full Monty and is still straining to produce another smash hit .
negative
for those for whom the name Woody Allen was once a guarantee of something fresh , sometimes funny , and usually genuinely worthwhile , Hollywood Ending is a depressing experience
negative
Femme Fatale offers nothing more than a bait-and-switch that is beyond playing fair with the audience .
negative
Are we dealing with dreams , visions or being told what actually happened as if it were the third ending of Clue ?
negative
It could have been something special , but two things drag it down to mediocrity -- director Clare Peploe 's misunderstanding of Marivaux 's rhythms , and Mira Sorvino 's limitations as a classical actress .
negative
Fluffy neo-noir hiding behind cutesy film references .
negative
Imagine Susan Sontag falling in love with Howard Stern .
negative
Should have been worth cheering as a breakthrough but is devoid of wit and humor .
negative
The best thing about the movie is its personable , amusing cast .
positive
These guys seem great to knock back a beer with but they 're simply not funny performers .
negative
Everything was as superficial as the forced New Jersey lowbrow accent Uma had .
negative
Director David Fincher and writer David Koepp ca n't sustain it .
negative
One of the most highly-praised disappointments I 've had the misfortune to watch in quite some time .
negative
Director Shekhar Kapur and screenwriters Michael Schiffer and Hossein Amini have tried hard to modernize and reconceptualize things , but the barriers finally prove to be too great .
negative
Strong filmmaking requires a clear sense of purpose , and in that oh-so-important category , The Four Feathers comes up short .
negative
The thought of watching this film with an audience full of teenagers fixating on its body humour and reinforcement of stereotypes ( of which they 'll get plenty ) fills me with revulsion .
negative
Devolves into the derivative , leaning on badly-rendered CGI effects .
negative
A grand fart coming from a director beginning to resemble someone 's crazy French grandfather .
negative
The script is a disaster , with cloying messages and irksome characters .
negative
Hollywood has taken quite a nosedive from Alfred Hitchcock 's imaginative flight to Shyamalan 's self-important summer fluff .
negative
The film 's maudlin focus on the young woman 's infirmity and her naive dreams play like the worst kind of Hollywood heart-string plucking .
negative
I firmly believe that a good video game movie is going to show up soon .
positive
I also believe that Resident Evil is not it .
negative
It has the air of a surprisingly juvenile lark , a pop-influenced prank whose charms are immediately apparent and wear thin with repetition .
negative
This is cruel , misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy .
negative
No amount of nostalgia for Carvey 's glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that Carvey 's considerable talents are wasted in it .
negative
Lazily directed by Charles Stone III ... from a leaden script by Matthew Cirulnick and novelist Thulani Davis .
negative
Though Jones and Snipes are enthralling , the movie bogs down in rhetoric and cliché .
negative
An artsploitation movie with too much exploitation and too little art .
negative
The pacing is often way off and there are too many bona fide groaners among too few laughs .
negative
Barely manages for but a few seconds over its seemingly eternal running time to pique your interest , your imagination , your empathy or anything , really , save your disgust and your indifference .
negative
Writer/director Burr Steers emphasizes the Q in Quirky , with mixed results .
positive
One senses in World Traveler and in his earlier film that Freundlich bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers , and circles it obsessively , without making contact .
negative
In between the icy stunts , the actors spout hilarious dialogue about following your dream and ` just letting the mountain tell you what to do . '
positive
is a mess .
negative
Hypnotically dull , relentlessly downbeat , laughably predictable wail pitched to the cadence of a depressed fifteen-year-old 's suicidal poetry .
negative
The concept is a hoot .
positive
The trailer is a riot .
positive
The movie is a dud .
negative
It 's a boring movie about a boring man , made watchable by a bravura performance from a consummate actor incapable of being boring .
positive
Because the intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work , the movie contains no wit , only labored gags .
negative
It 's hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie .
negative
These characters become wearisome .
negative
A hit - and-miss affair , consistently amusing but not as outrageous or funny as Cho may have intended or as imaginative as one might have hoped .
negative
This may be the first cartoon ever to look as if it were being shown on the projection television screen of a sports bar .
negative
Kim Ki-Deok seems to have in mind an ( emotionally at least ) adolescent audience demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested .
negative
After sitting through this sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special , it makes me wonder if Lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work .
negative
Contrived pastiche of caper clichés .
negative
Despite its sincere acting , Signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype .
negative
Loud , chaotic and largely unfunny .
negative
Qualities that were once amusing are becoming irritating .
negative
Well , Jason 's gone to Manhattan and Hell , I guess a space station in the year 2455 can be crossed off the list of ideas for the inevitable future sequels ( hey , do n't shoot the messenger ) .
negative
Donovan ... squanders his main asset , Jackie Chan , and fumbles the vital action sequences .
negative
There is no psychology here , and no real narrative logic -- just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities , which become strangely impersonal and abstract .
negative
Bread , My Sweet has so many flaws it would be easy for critics to shred it .
negative
Leaks treacle from every pore .
negative
The characters are so generic and the plot so bland that even as rogue CIA assassins working for Chris Cooper 's agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac , we do n't feel much for Damon/Bourne or his predicament .
negative
Kapur weighs down the tale with bogus profundities .
negative
Blue Crush is as predictable as the tides .
negative
... The movie feels stitched together from stock situations and characters from other movies .
negative
If you enjoy being rewarded by a script that assumes you are n't very bright , then Blood Work is for you .
negative
Trouble Every Day is a success in some sense , but it 's hard to like a film so cold and dead .
negative
A well-intentioned effort that 's still too burdened by the actor 's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility .
negative
Any reasonably creative eighth-grader could have written a more credible script , though with the same number of continuity errors .

Like an Afterschool Special with costumes by Gianni Versace , Mad Love looks better than it feels .
negative
The script , the gags , the characters are all direct-to-video stuff , and that 's where this film should have remained .
negative
A thriller without thrills and a mystery devoid of urgent questions .
negative
A collage of clichés and a dim echo of allusions to other films .
negative
The film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters .
negative
An excruciating demonstration of the unsalvageability of a movie saddled with an amateurish screenplay .
negative
How many more times will indie filmmakers subject us to boring , self-important stories of how horrible we are to ourselves and each other ?
negative
There are some laughs in this movie , but Williams ' anarchy gets tiresome , the satire is weak .
negative
As steamy as last week 's pork dumplings .
negative
The somber pacing and lack of dramatic fireworks make Green Dragon seem more like medicine than entertainment .
negative
The filmmakers needed more emphasis on the storytelling and less on the glamorous machine that thrusts the audience into a future they wo n't much care about .
negative
Another wholly unnecessary addition to the growing , moldering pile of , well , extreme stunt pictures .
negative
This strenuously unfunny Showtime deserves the hook .
negative
The whole thing 's fairly lame , making it par for the course for Disney sequels .
negative
... its solemn pretension prevents us from sharing the awe in which it holds itself .
negative
... the good and different idea ( of middle-aged romance ) is not handled well and , except for the fine star performances , there is little else to recommend `` Never Again . ''
negative
If Disney 's Cinderella proved that ' a dream is a wish your heart makes , ' then Cinderella II proves that a nightmare is a wish a studio 's wallet makes .
negative
Features nonsensical and laughable plotting , wooden performances , ineptly directed action sequences and some of the worst dialogue in recent memory .

Nothing about this movie works .

A spooky yarn of demonic doings on the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged .
negative
None of Birthday Girl 's calculated events take us by surprise ...
negative
Lisa Rinzler 's cinematography may be lovely , but Love Liza 's tale itself virtually collapses into an inhalant blackout , maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension .

It 's exactly the kind of movie Toback 's detractors always accuse him of making .

With the dog days of August upon us , think of this dog of a movie as the cinematic equivalent of high humidity .
negative
The film is like sitting in a downtown café , overhearing a bunch of typical late-twenty-somethings natter on about nothing , and desperately wishing you could change tables .
negative
This rather unfocused , all-over-the-map movie would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens ... or if it were subtler ... or if it had a sense of humor .
negative
Takes a clunky TV-movie approach to detailing a chapter in the life of the celebrated Irish playwright , poet and drinker .

Not only does the thoroughly formulaic film represent totally exemplify middle-of-the-road mainstream , it also represents glossy Hollywood at its laziest .

A shame that Stealing Harvard is too busy getting in its own way to be anything but frustrating , boring , and forgettable .

Nearly every attempt at humor here is DOA .

Those who are only mildly curious , I fear , will be put to sleep or bewildered by the artsy and often pointless visuals .

Though Tom Shadyac 's film kicks off spookily enough , around the halfway mark it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance .
negative
A long , dull procession of despair , set to cello music culled from a minimalist funeral .

A beautifully shot but dull and ankle-deep ` epic . '

`` Freaky Friday , '' it 's not .

Perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that is n't this painfully forced , false and fabricated .
negative
Although no pastry is violated , this nasty comedy pokes fun at the same easy targets as other rowdy raunch-fests -- farts , boobs , unmentionables -- without much success .

Somewhere inside the mess that is World Traveler , there is a mediocre movie trying to get out .
negative
An artful yet depressing film that makes a melodramatic mountain out of the molehill of a missing bike .
negative
The movie 's ultimate point -- that everyone should be themselves -- is trite , but the screenwriter and director Michel Gondry restate it to the point of ridiculousness .
negative
... expands the horizons of boredom to the point of collapse , turning into a black hole of dullness , from which no interesting concept can escape .
negative
Sad nonsense , this .
negative
But not without cheesy fun factor .
positive
One of those decades-spanning historical epics that strives to be intimate and socially encompassing but fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time .
negative
The movie wavers between Hallmark card sentimentality and goofy , life-affirming moments straight out of a cellular phone commercial .
negative
The director 's many dodges and turns add up to little more than a screenful of gamesmanship that 's low on both suspense and payoff .
negative
While the transgressive trappings ( especially the frank sex scenes ) ensure that the film is never dull , Rodrigues 's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative .
negative
The satire is unfocused , while the story goes nowhere .
negative
They threw loads of money at an idea that should 've been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans .
negative
It 's mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of Action Man cliché atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of ( Woo 's ) best work .

Reyes ' directorial debut has good things to offer , but ultimately it 's undone by a sloppy script

If you 're over 25 , have an IQ over 90 , and have a driver 's license , you should be able to find better entertainment .

The darker elements of misogyny and unprovoked violence suffocate the illumination created by the two daughters and the sparse instances of humor meant to shine through the gloomy film noir veil .
negative
Never does `` Lilo & Stitch '' reach the emotion or timelessness of Disney 's great past , or even that of more recent successes such as `` Mulan '' or `` Tarzan . ''
negative
One of those so-so films that could have been much better .
negative
Crossroads feels like a teenybopper Ed Wood film , replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo and the high-strung but flaccid drama .
negative
Fails to satisfactorily exploit its gender politics , genre thrills or inherent humor .
negative
Interview With the Assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its Blair Witch Project real-time roots .
negative
Cacoyannis ' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts .
negative
It has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie , which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline .
negative
It appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept .
negative
It 's not helpful to listen to extremist name-calling , regardless of whether you think Kissinger was a calculating fiend or just a slippery self-promoter .

Abandon spends 90 minutes trying figure out whether or not some cocky pseudo-intellectual kid has intentionally left college or was killed .
negative
The only problem is that , by the end , no one in the audience or the film seems to really care .

No Such Thing is sort of a minimalist Beauty and the Beast , but in this case the Beast should definitely get top billing .

Robert John Burke as The Monster horns in and steals the show .

( T ) he film is never sure to make a clear point -- even if it seeks to rely on an ambiguous presentation .

While it may not add up to the sum of its parts , Holofcener 's film offers just enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded , and the ensemble cast is engaging enough to keep you from shifting in your chair too often .
positive
Nobody seems to have cared much about any aspect of it , from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its last-minute , haphazard theatrical release .
negative
A thoroughly awful movie -- dumb , narratively chaotic , visually sloppy ... a weird amalgam of ` The Thing ' and a geriatric ` Scream . '
negative
... another example of how Sandler is losing his touch .
negative
Nothing sticks , really , except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad , sordid universe of guns , drugs , avarice and damaged dreams .

What goes on for the 110 minutes of `` Panic Room '' is a battle of witlessness between a not-so-bright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals .

The plot 's contrivances are uncomfortably strained .

Guilty of the worst sin of attributable to a movie like this : it 's not scary in the slightest .
negative
Schnieder bounces around with limp wrists , wearing tight tummy tops and hip huggers , twirling his hair on his finger and assuming that 's enough to sustain laughs ...
negative
Its simplicity puts an exclamation point on the fact that this is n't something to be taken seriously , but it also wrecks any chance of the movie rising above similar fare .
negative
By the final whistle you 're convinced that this Mean Machine was a decent TV outing that just does n't have big screen magic .
negative
To say that this vapid vehicle is downright doltish and uneventful is just as obvious as telling a country skunk that he has severe body odor .

A film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun .

Pretend it 's a werewolf itself by avoiding eye contact and walking slowly away .

It 's fun , but it 's a real howler .

Some fine acting , but ultimately a movie with no reason for being .
negative
It 's difficult to feel anything much while watching this movie , beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting .
negative
A waterlogged version of ` Fatal Attraction ' for the teeny-bopper set ... a sad , soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads .
negative
Sweet gentle Jesus , did the screenwriters just do a cut-and-paste of every bad action-movie line in history ?
negative
This is for the most part a useless movie , even with a great director at the helm .
negative
A loud , witless mess that has none of the charm and little of the intrigue from the TV series .
negative
Even on its own ludicrous terms , The Sum of All Fears generates little narrative momentum , and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the Ryan series .
negative
As predictable as the outcome of a Globetrotters-Generals game , Juwanna Mann is even more ludicrous than you 'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved .
negative
Where Tom Green stages his gags as assaults on America 's knee-jerk moral sanctimony , Jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval .

The April 2002 instalment of the American War for Independence , complete with loads of CGI and bushels of violence , but not a drop of human blood .
negative
Contains all the substance of a Twinkie -- easy to swallow , but scarcely nourishing .
negative
Return to Neverland manages to straddle the line between another classic for the company and just another run-of-the-mill Disney sequel intended for the home video market .
negative
Rarely does a film so graceless and devoid of merit as this one come along .
negative
It 's a thin notion , repetitively stretched out to feature length , awash in self-consciously flashy camera effects , droning house music and flat , flat dialogue .
negative
The colorful Masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of Ganesh 's rise up the social ladder .
negative
... an incredibly heavy-handed , manipulative dud that feels all too familiar .
negative
Wimps out by going for that PG-13 rating , so the more graphic violence is mostly off-screen and the sexuality is muted .
negative
Trapped presents a frightening and compelling ` What if ? '
positive
Madonna has made herself over so often now , there 's apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like Michael Jackson 's nose .
negative
Never having seen the first two films in the series , I ca n't compare Friday After Next to them , but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days .
negative
The story is lacking any real emotional impact , and the plot is both contrived and cliched .
negative
A depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece of hackery .
negative
It 's a bad action movie because there 's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring .
negative
( Soderbergh ) tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience 's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness .
negative
So aggressively cheery that Pollyana would reach for a barf bag .
negative
Scooby-Doo does n't know if it wants to be a retro-refitting exercise in campy recall for older fans or a silly , Nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick .
negative
Russell lacks the visual panache , the comic touch , and perhaps the budget of Sommers 's title-bout features .
negative
Highly uneven and inconsistent ... Margarita Happy Hour kinda resembles the el cheapo margaritas served within .
negative
Very stupid and annoying .

The Sum of All Fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , but it 's really nothing more than warmed-over Cold War paranoia .

A listless and desultory affair .
negative
Represents the depths to which the girls-behaving-badly film has fallen .
negative
How inept is Serving Sara ?
negative
It makes even Elizabeth Hurley seem graceless and ugly .
negative
Helmer Hudlin tries to make a hip comedy , but his dependence on slapstick defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome .
negative
Lazy , miserable and smug .
negative
This is one of the biggest disappointments of the year .
negative
Every visual joke is milked , every set-up obvious and lengthy , every punchline predictable .
negative
There 's no energy .
negative
This is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like Them !
negative
At three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue .
negative
If you recognize Zeus ( the dog from Snatch ) it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one .
negative
This is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , ` Ah , yes , here we have a bad , bad , bad movie . '
negative
There 's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man 's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present .
negative
It 's at once laughable and compulsively watchable , in its committed dumbness .
positive
All the sensuality , all the eroticism of a good vampire tale has been , pardon the pun , sucked out and replaced by goth goofiness .
negative
A cross between Blow and Boyz N The Hood , this movie strives to be more , but does n't quite get there .
negative
Good performances keep it from being a total rehash .
positive
The screenplay is hugely overwritten , with tons and tons of dialogue -- most of it given to children .
negative
At times , the movie looks genuinely pretty .
positive
Not even Felinni would know what to make of this Italian freakshow .
negative
It 's difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in Slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny .
negative
Despite its promising cast of characters , Big Trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that ` zany ' does n't necessarily mean ` funny . '
negative
Both shrill and soporific , and because everything is repeated five or six times , it can seem tiresomely simpleminded .
negative
Does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny .
negative
Neither revelatory nor truly edgy -- merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored .
negative
Just about everyone involved here seems to be coasting .
negative
Fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur .
negative
There 's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film 's simple title .
negative
A preposterous , prurient whodunit .
negative
Go , girls , right down the reality drain .
negative
Boasting some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory , Impostor is as close as you can get to an imitation movie .
negative
Can be classified as one of those ` alternate reality ' movies ... except that it would have worked so much better dealing in only one reality .
negative
Predictable and cloying , though Brown Sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle .
positive
... unlikable , uninteresting , unfunny , and completely , utterly inept .
negative
The film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own .
negative
An imponderably stilted and self-consciously arty movie .
negative
Muddled , melodramatic paranormal romance is an all-time low for Kevin Costner .
negative
Too clumsy in key moments ... to make a big splash .
negative
Just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that 's neither original nor terribly funny .
negative
` Matrix ' - style massacres erupt throughout ... but the movie has a tougher time balancing its violence with Kafka-inspired philosophy .
negative
At least it 's a fairly impressive debut from the director , Charles Stone III .
positive
It all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense .
negative
Run for your lives !
negative
Why would anyone cast the magnificent Jackie Chan in a movie full of stunt doubles and special effects ?
negative
A grating , emaciated flick .
negative
Unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook .
negative
We have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat .
negative
According to the script , Grant and Bullock 's characters are made for each other .
positive
Ararat feels like a book report
negative
Steve Oedekerk is , alas , no Woody Allen .
negative
A lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless .
negative
The acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing .
negative
Shows that Jackie Chan is getting older , and that 's something I would rather live in denial about
negative
The slapstick is labored , and the bigger setpieces flat .
negative
This is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks .
negative
The problem with the mayhem in Formula 51 is not that it 's offensive , but that it 's boring .
negative
Much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome cliché .
negative
the film never rises above a conventional , two dimension tale
negative
Told in scattered fashion , the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject .
negative
The irony is that this film 's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own .
positive
If ever a concept came handed down from the movie gods on a silver platter , this is it .
positive
If ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it .
negative
With an unusual protagonist ( a kilt-wearing Jackson ) and subject matter , the improbable `` Formula 51 '' is somewhat entertaining , but it could have been much stronger .
positive
A feel-good movie that does n't give you enough to feel good about .
negative
Adolescents will be adequately served by the movie 's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a ` topless tutorial service . '
positive
This mistaken-identity picture is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost .
negative
The picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment .
negative
You 'll cry for your money back .
negative
Slap me , I saw this movie .
negative
( The kid 's ) just too bratty for sympathy , and as the film grows to its finale , his little changes ring hollow .
negative
Behind the glitz , Hollywood is sordid and disgusting .
negative
Scherfig , who has had a successful career in TV , tackles more than she can handle .
negative
Just consider what New Best Friend does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay .
negative
Oscar caliber cast does n't live up to material
negative
They just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way .
negative
Carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , Chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , ` If I stay positive , maybe I can channel one of my greatest pictures , Drunken Master . '
negative
So putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film .
negative
In the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about Kennedy 's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate .
negative
Starts out ballsy and stylish but fails to keep it up and settles into clichés .
negative
Sometimes makes less sense than the Bruckheimeresque American action flicks it emulates .
negative
One of those films where the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids , children behave like adults and everyone screams at the top of their lungs no matter what the situation .
negative
There 's only one way to kill Michael Myers for good : stop buying tickets to these movies .
negative
The movie is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive .
negative
In other words , about as bad a film you 're likely to see all year .
negative
Five screenwriters are credited with the cliché-laden screenplay ; it seems as if each watered down the version of the one before .
negative
The whole thing comes off like a particularly amateurish episode of Bewitched that takes place during Spring Break .
negative
Well made but uninvolving , Bloodwork is n't a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery .
negative
So we got Ten Little Indians meets Friday the 13th by way of Clean and Sober , filmed on the set of Carpenter 's The Thing and loaded with actors you 're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of The Love Boat .
negative
The movie 's blatant derivativeness is one reason it 's so lackluster .
negative
Kids do n't mind crappy movies as much as adults , provided there 's lots of cute animals and clumsy people .
negative
It 's the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who does n't think about percentages all day long .
negative
Ken Russell would love this .
positive
In one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of Quentin Tarantino 's climactic shootout -- and Meat Loaf explodes .
negative
This is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer .
negative
The premise of `` Abandon '' holds promise , ... but its delivery is a complete mess .
negative
A little too ponderous to work as shallow entertainment , not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama , Monsoon Wedding serves mostly to whet one 's appetite for the Bollywood films .
negative
Unless Bob Crane is someone of particular interest to you , this film 's impressive performances and adept direction are n't likely to leave a lasting impression .
negative
The bottom line with Nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series : Fans will undoubtedly enjoy it , and the uncommitted need n't waste their time on it .
positive
The lousy John Q all but spits out Denzel Washington 's fine performance in the title role .
negative
The whole thing feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas .
negative
What a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is !
negative
The film is so packed with subplots involving the various Silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a TV series than a feature film .
negative
Opera on film is never satisfactory .
negative
The art demands live viewing .
positive
The innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen .
negative
Despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless .
negative
It is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill
negative
The Sweetest Thing leaves an awful sour taste .
negative
It 's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay .
negative
Terminally bland , painfully slow and needlessly confusing ... The movie , shot on digital videotape rather than film , is frequently indecipherable .
negative
As dumb and cheesy as they may be , the cartoons look almost Shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy .
positive
Aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships .
negative
A low-rent retread of the Alien pictures .
negative
Its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche .
negative
A big meal of cliches that the talented cast generally chokes on .
negative
The story has little wit and no surprises .
negative
The Merchant-Ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema , only now it 's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage .
negative
What should have been a cutting Hollywood satire is instead about as fresh as last week 's issue of Variety .
negative
Hey everybody , wanna watch a movie in which a guy dressed as a children 's party clown gets violently gang-raped ?
negative
A little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt .
negative
( T ) his slop does n't even have potential as a cult film , as it 's too loud to shout insults at the screen .
negative
The movie 's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh .
negative
... may work as an addictive guilty pleasure but the material never overcomes its questionable satirical ambivalence .
negative
as in aimless , arduous , and arbitrary .
negative
Plays like a glossy melodrama that occasionally verges on camp .
negative
A puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks .
negative
Just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another , making Ararat far more demanding than it needs to be .
negative
A little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium .
negative
There 's a heavy stench of ` been there , done that ' hanging over the film .
negative
The biggest problem with Satin Rouge is Lilia herself .
negative
A quaint , romanticized rendering .
positive
A potentially good comic premise and excellent cast are terribly wasted .
negative
Woody Allen used to ridicule movies like Hollywood Ending .
negative
Been there done that .
negative
There is only so much baked cardboard I need to chew .
negative
A movie like The Guys is why film criticism can be considered work .
negative
Even if it made its original release date last fall , it would 've reeked of a been-there , done-that sameness .
negative
A loud , ugly , irritating movie without any of its satirical salvos hitting a discernible target .
negative
A movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture .
negative
We can tell what it is supposed to be , but ca n't really call it a work of art .
negative
Bravado Kathy !
positive
... Liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character 's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario .
negative
Too bad .
negative
Unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters , the Reginald Hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs .
negative
This romantic/comedy asks the question how much souvlaki can you take before indigestion sets in .
negative
Squandering his opportunity to make absurdist observations , Burns gets caught up in the rush of slapstick thoroughfare .
negative
It has no affect on the Kurds , but it wore me down .
negative
The actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen .
negative
Co-writer/director Jonathan Parker 's attempts to fashion a Brazil-like , hyper-real satire fall dreadfully short .
negative
A superfluous sequel ... plagued by that old familiar feeling of ` let 's get this thing over with ' : Everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find .
negative
If there 's a heaven for bad movies , Deuces Wild is on its way .
negative
Comes off like a bad imitation of the Bard .
negative
What 's missing in Murder by Numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens ' deviant behaviour .
negative
An uninspired preachy and clichéd war film .
negative
Horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it is n't incomprehensible .
negative
A movie that harps on media-constructed ` issues ' like whether compromise is the death of self ... this Orgasm ( wo n't be an ) exceedingly memorable one for most people .
negative
If Festival in Cannes nails hard - boiled Hollywood argot with a bracingly nasty accuracy , much about the film , including some of its casting , is frustratingly unconvincing .
negative
The movie is too impressed with its own solemn insights to work up much entertainment value .
negative
I have n't seen such self-amused trash since Freddy Got Fingered .
negative
Little more than a well-mounted history lesson .
negative
Rob Schneider 's infantile cross-dressing routines fill The Hot Chick , the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian .
negative
A horrible , 99-minute stink bomb .
negative
The film is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil .
negative
The film is so bad it does n't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen .
negative
Sheridan 's take on the author 's schoolboy memoir ... is a rather toothless take on a hard young life .
negative
It jumps around with little logic or continuity , presenting backstage bytes of information that never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular , anciently demanding métier .
negative
When it comes to the battle of Hollywood vs. Woo , it looks like Woo 's a P.O.W.
negative
The Chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones , but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film .
negative
It 's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast .
negative
The mushy finale turns John Q into a movie-of-the-week tearjerker .
positive
Content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance .
negative
The movie turns out to be ( Assayas ' ) homage to the Gallic ` tradition of quality , ' in all its fusty squareness .
negative
Its message has merit and , in the hands of a brutally honest individual like Prophet Jack , might have made a point or two regarding life .
negative
( Seems ) even more uselessly redundant and shamelessly money-grubbing than most third-rate horror sequels .
negative
It 's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread .
negative
Neither as scary-funny as Tremors nor demented-funny as Starship Troopers , the movie is n't tough to take as long as you 've paid a matinee price .
negative
If swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh .
negative
The Master of Disguise may have made a great Saturday Night Live sketch , but a great movie it is not .
negative
It 's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the Cannes Film Festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere .
negative
Boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect .
negative
It 's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic .
negative
Unfortunately , that 's precisely what Arthur Dong 's Family Fundamentals does .
negative
Like a medium-grade network sitcom -- mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen .
negative
Something must have been lost in the translation .
negative
Becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any Plympton film : boring .
negative
In the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we 're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses .
negative
Chan 's stunts are limited and so embellished by editing that there 's really not much of a sense of action or even action-comedy .
negative
Rock 's stand-up magic wanes .
negative
Hopkins , squarely fills the screen .
positive
Action - mechanical .
negative
Alas , it 's the man that makes the clothes .
positive
For casual moviegoers who stumble into Rules expecting a slice of American Pie hijinks starring the kid from Dawson 's Creek , they 'll probably run out screaming .
negative
The biggest problem I have ( other than the very sluggish pace ) is we never really see her Esther blossom as an actress , even though her talent is supposed to be growing .
negative
Plot , characters , drama , emotions , ideas -- all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing The Scorpion King .
negative
City by the Sea is a gritty police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics one could wish for .
positive
But how it washed out despite all of that is the project 's prime mystery .
negative
Whatever the movie 's sentimental , hypocritical lessons about sexism , its true colors come out in various wet T-shirt and shower scenes .
negative
I enjoyed the movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was .
positive
What a pity ... that the material is so second-rate .
negative
Does n't deliver a great story , nor is the action as gripping as in past Seagal films .
negative
The kind of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an ill-advised and poorly executed idea .
negative
Nicks refuses to let Slackers be seen as just another teen movie , which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy .
positive
Nothing about the film -- with the possible exception of Elizabeth Hurley 's breasts -- is authentic .
negative
Mostly , Shafer and co-writer Gregory Hinton lack a strong-minded viewpoint , or a sense of humor .
negative
No cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces Wild .
negative
Eddie Murphy and Owen Wilson have a cute partnership in I Spy , but the movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm does n't do a load of good .
negative
Strictly a ` guy 's film ' in the worst sense of the expression .
negative
There 's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes .
negative
It 's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as Phoenix 's .
negative
There 's something fishy about a seasonal holiday kids ' movie ... that derives its moment of most convincing emotional gravity from a scene where Santa gives gifts to grownups .
negative
We 're left with a story that tries to grab us , only to keep letting go at all the wrong moments .
negative
Like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories .
negative
There is nothing redeeming about this movie .
negative
The film has ( its ) moments , but they are few and far between .
negative
I was trying to decide what annoyed me most about God is Great ... I 'm Not , and then I realized that I just did n't care .
negative
Derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone .
negative
... comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental .
negative
Brosnan 's finest non-Bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film 's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes .
negative
A film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , Waiting for Happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact .
positive
To me , it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy .
negative
Flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they ca n't distract from the flawed support structure holding Equilibrium up .
negative
ZigZag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted .
negative
How can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing ?
negative
In truth , it has all the heart of a porno flick ( but none of the sheer lust ) .
negative
Nicks and Steinberg match their own creations for pure venality -- that 's giving it the old college try .
negative
Episode II -- Attack of the Clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and delight .
negative
The problem with all of this : It 's not really funny .
negative
( Denis ' ) bare-bones narrative more closely resembles an outline for a '70s exploitation picture than the finished product .
negative
Wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from Lynch , Jeunet , and von Trier while failing to find a spark of its own .
negative
Overall tomfoolery like this is a matter of taste .
negative
The mantra behind the project seems to have been ` it 's just a kids ' flick . '
negative
Translation : ` We do n't need to try very hard . '
negative
In all the annals of the movies , few films have been this odd , inexplicable and unpleasant .
negative
It takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what TUCK EVERLASTING is about .
negative
an essentially awkward version of the lightweight female empowerment picture we 've been watching for decades
negative
The author 's devotees will probably find it fascinating ; others may find it baffling .
negative
Writer-director Walter Hill and co-writer David Giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags .
negative
There 's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : Mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces .
negative
A cockeyed shot all the way .
negative
Lush and beautifully photographed ( somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book ) , but ultimately you 'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered .
negative
Unfortunately , One Hour Photo lives down to its title .
negative
Thanks largely to Williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film .
negative
Cold , Sterile And Lacking Any Color Or Warmth .
negative
The film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold .
negative
Seems like someone going through the motions .
negative
For a film about explosions and death and spies , `` Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever '' seems as safe as a children 's film .
negative
Well , in some of those , the mother deer even dies .
negative
Choppy , overlong documentary about ` The Lifestyle . '
negative
One sloughs one 's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot .
negative
A film which presses familiar Herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised .
negative
brought to life on the big screen .
positive
The story itself is actually quite vapid .
negative
It 's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it does n't offer any insights that have n't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the Dahmer heyday of the mid - '90s .
negative
A few zingers aside , the writing is indifferent , and Jordan Brady 's direction is prosaic .
negative
Each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and sentiment is slathered on top .
negative
Would 've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film 's predictable denouement .
negative
Nair just does n't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy .
negative
Enthusiastically taking up the current teen movie concern with bodily functions , Walt Becker 's film pushes all the demographically appropriate comic buttons .
positive
It 's the funniest American comedy since Graffiti Bridge .
positive
That neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions , defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks .
negative
What starts off as a possible Argentine American Beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers .
negative
The project 's filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger Fatal Attraction into a high school setting .
negative
In old-fashioned screenwriting parlance , Ms. Shreve 's novel proved too difficult a text to ` lick , ' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast .
negative
Solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke
negative
Stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little **** .
negative
No cute factor here ... Not that I mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise .
negative
Deep down , I realized the harsh reality of my situation : I would leave the theater with a lower I.Q. than when I had entered .
negative
Aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom.com or the improperly hammy performance from poor Stephen Rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand .
negative
It is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment .
negative
For its 100 minutes running time , you 'll wait in vain for a movie to happen .
negative
A work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse .
negative
A faster paced family flick .
positive
Upper Teens may get cynical .
negative
Smaller numbered kidlets will enjoy .
positive
While this film has an ` A ' list cast and some strong supporting players , the tale -- like its central figure , Vivi -- is just a little bit hard to love .
negative
It 's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns .
negative
Most fish stories are a little peculiar , but this is one that should be thrown back in the river .
negative
The movie is about as deep as that sentiment .
negative
I 've seen some bad singer-turned actors , but Lil Bow Wow takes the cake .
negative
By halfway through this picture I was beginning to hate it , and , of course , feeling guilty for it ... Then , miracle of miracles , the movie does a flip-flop .
positive
made Eddie Murphy a movie star and the man has n't aged a day .
positive
But it was n't .
negative
For a film about action , Ultimate X is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever , bogging down in a barrage of hype .
negative
... a low rate Annie featuring some kid who ca n't act , only echoes of Jordan , and weirdo actor Crispin Glover screwing things up old school .
negative
It might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the Saturday morning cartoons -- a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness .
negative
The picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male All About Eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the Intermezzo strain .
negative
A nearly 21/2 hours , the film is way too indulgent .
negative
Gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid ... a curiously constricted epic .
negative
With a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , Personal Velocity seems to be idling in neutral .
negative
Does n't really add up to much .
negative
It 's better suited for the history or biography channel , but there 's no arguing the tone of the movie - it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and questions on your mind .
negative
An entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots .
negative
A prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp .
negative
Borrows from other movies like it in the most ordinary and obvious fashion .
negative
It 's surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction .
negative
A chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece ... so dull that its tagline should be : ` In space , no one can hear you snore . '
negative
The characters seem one-dimensional , and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience .
negative
Sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor Hermocrates and Leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours .
negative
It 's like a drive-by .
negative
You can drive right by it without noticing anything special , save for a few comic turns , intended and otherwise .
negative
Everything -- even life on an aircraft carrier -- is sentimentalized .
negative
This would-be ` James Bond for the Extreme Generation ' pic is one big , dumb action movie .
negative
Stress ` dumb . '
negative
When your subject is illusion versus reality , should n't the reality seem at least passably real ?
negative
It 's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch .
negative
This is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea ( or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really ) in sight , and the whole of the proceedings beg the question ` Why ? '
negative
A fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down .
negative
Too infuriatingly quirky and taken with its own style .
negative
There 's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age/coming-out tale .
negative
As much as I laughed throughout the movie , I can not mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys ' superhuman capacity to withstand pain .
positive
The type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the ( teen comedy ) genre a bad name .
negative
Distinctly sub-par ... more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine .
negative
Plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of TV 's Dawson 's Creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of Love Story .
negative
Unless you come in to the film with a skateboard under your arm , you 're going to feel like you were n't invited to the party .
negative
When the casting call for this movie went out , it must have read ` seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame . '
negative
Just is n't as weird as it ought to be .
negative
A `` Home Alone '' film that is staged like `` Rosemary 's Baby , '' but is not as well-conceived as either of those films .
negative
( Siegel ) and co-writers Lisa Bazadona and Grace Woodard have relied too much on convention in creating the characters who surround Frankie .
negative
No film could possibly be more contemptuous of the single female population .
negative
A sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative hem the movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women .
negative
A low-budget affair , Tadpole was shot on digital video , and the images often look smeary and blurry , to the point of distraction .
negative
Then again , in a better movie , you might not have noticed .
negative
The movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the `` webcast . ''
negative
tale will be all too familiar for anyone who 's seen George Roy Hill 's 1973 film , `` The Sting . ''
negative
Gets the look and the period trappings right , but it otherwise drowns in a sea of visual and verbal clichés .
negative
It 's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles , but Notorious C.H.O. still feels like a promising work-in-progress .
positive
Anyone who wants to start writing screenplays can just follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films , sell it to the highest bidder and walk away without anyone truly knowing your identity .
negative
The problem with The Bread , My Sweet is that it 's far too sentimental .
negative
Never inspires more than an interested detachment .
negative
What might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of Woody Allen or Mel Brooks ( at least during their '70s heyday ) comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature .
negative
Despite slick production values and director Roger Michell 's tick-tock pacing , the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours .
negative
Pretty much sucks , but has a funny moment or two .
negative
A supernatural mystery that does n't know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama .
negative
It ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors .
negative
Two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity .
negative
These are textbook lives of quiet desperation .
negative
Claims to sort the bad guys from the good , which is its essential problem .
negative
Purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore , if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons .
negative
Feels like pieces a bunch of other , better movies slapped together .
negative
Writer-director Randall Wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew , and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic .
negative
It follows the Blair Witch formula for an hour , in which we 're told something creepy and vague is in the works , and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes .
negative
One ca n't shake the feeling that Crossroads is nothing more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for Britney 's latest album .
negative
Phoned-in business as usual .
negative
What little atmosphere is generated by the shadowy lighting , macabre sets , and endless rain is offset by the sheer ugliness of everything else .
negative
Tartakovsky 's team has some freakish powers of visual charm , but the five writers slip into the modern rut of narrative banality .
negative
The most horrific movie experience I 've had since `` Ca n't Stop The Music . ''
negative
It may as well be called `` Jar-Jar Binks : The Movie . ''
negative
It 's that painful .
negative
Like a three-ring circus , there are side stories aplenty -- none of them memorable .
negative
A ` Girls Gone Wild ' video for the boho art-house crowd , The Burning Sensation is n't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers are n't removed and inquisitive enough for that .
negative
As original and insightful as last week 's episode of Behind the Music .
negative
Plays like John Le Carré with a couple of burnt-out cylinders .
negative
You may be galled that you 've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie .
negative
It 's neither as sappy as Big Daddy nor as anarchic as Happy Gilmore or The Waterboy , but it has its moments .
positive
Despite the surface attractions -- Conrad L. Hall 's cinematography will likely be nominated for an Oscar next year -- there 's something impressive and yet lacking about everything .
positive
A smug and convoluted action-comedy that does n't allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it 's only a movie .
negative
Worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames .
negative
The Christ allegory does n't work because there is no foundation for it
negative
It 's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress .
negative
Tries too hard to be funny in a way that 's too loud , too goofy and too short of an attention span .
negative
I did n't find much fascination in the swinging .
negative
What they 're doing is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games , of no erotic or sensuous charge .
negative
But that they are doing it is thought-provoking .
positive
The acting is just fine , but there 's not enough substance here to sustain interest for the full 90 minutes , especially with the weak payoff .
negative
After Collateral Damage , you might imagine that most every aggrieved father cliché has been unturned .
negative
But no. .
negative
Ultimately the , yes , snail-like pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary , like some sort of Martha Stewart decorating program run amok .
negative
Releasing a film with the word ` dog ' in its title in January lends itself to easy jokes and insults , and Snow Dogs deserves every single one of them .
negative
Tedious Norwegian offering which somehow snagged an Oscar nomination .
negative
A dark-as-pitch comedy that frequently veers into corny sentimentality , probably would not improve much after a therapeutic zap of shock treatment .
negative
Bray is completely at sea ; with nothing but a Savage Garden music video on his resume , he has no clue about making a movie .
negative
a huge disappointment coming , as it does , from filmmakers and performers of this calibre
negative
Though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers , it 's exploitive without being insightful .
negative
What starts off as a satisfying kids flck becomes increasingly implausible as it races through contrived plot points .
negative
Exhibits the shallow sensationalism characteristic of soap opera ... more salacious telenovela than serious drama .
negative
Seagal is painfully foolish in trying to hold onto what 's left of his passe ' chopsocky glory .
negative
The story is bogus and its characters tissue-thin .
negative
is an inexpressible and drab wannabe looking for that exact niche .
negative
While American Adobo has its heart ( and its palate ) in the right place , its brain is a little scattered -- ditsy , even .
negative
Imagine a film that begins as a Seven rip-off , only to switch to a mix of The Shining , The Thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s .
negative
Most of the dialogue made me want to pack raw dough in my ears .
negative
Costner 's warm-milk persona is just as ill-fitting as Shadyac 's perfunctory directing chops , and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink Laurence Olivier .
negative
It 's coherent , well shot , and tartly acted , but it wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate .
negative
Directed by Kevin Bray , whose crisp framing , edgy camera work , and wholesale ineptitude with acting , tone and pace very obviously mark him as a video helmer making his feature debut .
positive
turns a potentially interesting idea into an excruciating film school experience that plays better only for the film 's publicists or for people who take as many drugs as the film 's characters
negative
High Crimes is a cinematic misdemeanor , a routine crime thriller remarkable only for its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors , Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd .
negative
Set in a 1986 Harlem that does n't look much like anywhere in New York .
negative
The chocolate factory without Charlie .
negative
Long on twinkly-eyed close-ups and short on shame .
negative
Hip-hop rarely comes alive as its own fire-breathing entity in this picture .
negative
A dull , somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise .
negative
Deserving of its critical backlash and more .
negative
Still , it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered .
negative
The Sum of All Fears is remarkably fuddled about motives and context , which drains it of the dramatic substance that would shake us in our boots ( or cinema seats ) .
negative
The movie spends more time with Schneider than with newcomer McAdams , even though her performance is more interesting ( and funnier ) than his .
negative
This low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the Farrelly brothers ' oeuvre gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time .
negative
It recycles every cliché about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera .
negative
May offend viewers not amused by the sick sense of humor .
negative
It aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one .
negative
If you 're not fans of the adventues of Steve and Terri , you should avoid this like the dreaded King Brown snake .
negative
Personally , I 'd rather watch them on the Animal Planet .
negative
Cherish is a dud -- a romantic comedy that 's not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny .
negative
All of the filmmakers ' calculations ca n't rescue Brown Sugar from the curse of blandness .
negative
... post-September 11 , `` The Sum Of All Fears '' seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves .
negative
The exclamation point seems to be the only bit of glee you 'll find in this dreary mess .
negative
Godard 's ode to tackling life 's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess ... In Praise of Love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that 's unfocused and tediously exasperating .
negative
Humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention .
negative
The movie 's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase ` fatal script error . '
negative
Solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say , but he is n't talking a talk that appeals to me .
negative
More tiring than anything .
negative
Nelson 's intentions are good , but the end result does no justice to the story itself .
negative
It 's horribly depressing and not very well done .
negative
... the efforts of its star , Kline , to lend some dignity to a dumb story are for naught .
negative
A good-natured ensemble comedy that tries hard to make the most of a bumper cast , but never quite gets off the ground .
negative
Is n't it a bit early in his career for director Barry Sonnenfeld to do a homage to himself ?
negative
And it 's a lousy one at that .
negative
Overly long and worshipful bio-doc .
negative
I 'll go out on a limb .
positive
It is n't quite one of the worst movies of the year .
negative
It 's just merely very bad .
negative
Writer-director Ritchie reduces Wertmuller 's social mores and politics to tiresome jargon .
negative
Everything about Girls Ca n't Swim , even its passages of sensitive observation , feels secondhand , familiar -- and not in a good way .
negative
Feels aimless for much of its running time , until late in the film when a tidal wave of plot arrives , leaving questions in its wake .
negative
In my own very humble opinion , In Praise of Love lacks even the most fragmented charms I have found in almost all of his previous works .
negative
The script is too mainstream and the psychology too textbook to intrigue .
negative
Muddled , simplistic and more than a little pretentious .
negative
A disaster of a drama , saved only by its winged assailants .
negative
Director Elie Chouraqui , who co-wrote the script , catches the chaotic horror of war , but why bother if you 're going to subjugate truth to the tear-jerking demands of soap opera ?
negative
Dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he 's dissecting , and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation .
negative
If there was any doubt that Peter O'Fallon did n't have an original bone in his body , A Rumor of Angels should dispel it .
negative
An occasionally interesting but mostly repetitive look at a slice of counterculture that might be best forgotten .
negative
What could have been right at home as a nifty plot line in Steven Soderbergh 's Traffic fails to arrive at any satisfying destination .
negative
The movie is like Scorsese 's Mean Streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old ` juvenile delinquent ' paperbacks with titles like Leather Warriors and Switchblade Sexpot .
negative
This pathetic junk is barely an hour long .
negative
Nevertheless , it still seems endless .
negative
It is n't that Stealing Harvard is a horrible movie -- if only it were that grand a failure !
negative
It 's just that it 's so not-at-all-good .
negative
Is it possible for a documentary to be utterly entranced by its subject and still show virtually no understanding of it ?
negative
It 's supposed to be a romantic comedy - it suffers from too much Norma Rae and not enough Pretty Woman .
negative
The leads are so unmemorable , despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes , that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer 's secondhand material .
negative
Staggers between flaccid satire and what is supposed to be madcap farce .
negative
Not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days , but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired .
negative
Plays like the old disease-of-the-week small-screen melodramas .
negative
Like life on the island , the movie grows boring despite the scenery .
negative
The truth about Charlie is that it 's a brazenly misguided project .
negative
So exaggerated and broad that it comes off as annoying rather than charming .
negative
An awkward hybrid of genres that just does n't work .
negative
The latest vapid actor 's exercise to appropriate the structure of Arthur Schnitzler 's Reigen .
negative
Snipes is both a snore and utter tripe .
negative
Ritchie 's film is easier to swallow than Wertmuller 's polemical allegory , but it 's self-defeatingly decorous .
negative
Chalk it up as the worst kind of hubristic folly .
negative
It 's the kind of under-inspired , overblown enterprise that gives Hollywood sequels a bad name .
negative
Rosenthal ( Halloween II ) seems to have forgotten everything he ever knew about generating suspense .
negative
Even Murphy 's expert comic timing and famed charisma ca n't rescue this effort .
negative
A sleek advert for youthful anomie that never quite equals the sum of its pretensions .
negative
Some Body smacks of exhibitionism more than it does cathartic truth telling .
negative
Apparently , romantic comedy with a fresh point of view just does n't figure in the present Hollywood program .
negative
Depressingly thin and exhaustingly contrived .
negative
Only masochistic moviegoers need apply .

A movie that 's held captive by mediocrity .

David Spade as Citizen Kane ?

The problem , amazingly enough , is the screenplay .
negative
It 's a Frankenstein-monster of a film that does n't know what it wants to be .
negative
Upper West Sidey exercise in narcissism and self-congratulation disguised as a tribute .
negative
On its icy face , the new film is a subzero version of Monsters , Inc. , without the latter 's imagination , visual charm or texture .
negative
I ca n't say this enough : This movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies .
negative
It 's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex .
negative
After a while , the only way for a reasonably intelligent person to get through The Country Bears is to ponder how a whole segment of pop-music history has been allowed to get wet , fuzzy and sticky .
negative
The film is grossly contradictory in conveying its social message , if indeed there is one .
negative
Often lingers just as long on the irrelevant as on the engaging , which gradually turns What Time Is It There ?

Too bad Kramer could n't make a guest appearance to liven things up .

Deuces Wild is an encyclopedia of cliches that shoplifts shamelessly from farewell-to-innocence movies like The Wanderers and A Bronx Tale without cribbing any of their intelligence .
negative
It 's a barely tolerable slog over well-trod ground .
negative
Epps has neither the charisma nor the natural affability that has made Tucker a star .

A dull , dumb and derivative horror film .

An awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism .
negative
Demme gets a lot of flavor and spice into his Charade remake , but he ca n't disguise that he 's spiffing up leftovers that are n't so substantial or fresh .
negative
This is a heartfelt story ... it just is n't a very involving one .
negative
These self-styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and furiously , their capacity to explain themselves has gone the same way as their natural instinct for self-preservation .
negative
The fact that the ` best part ' of the movie comes from a 60-second homage to one of Demme 's good films does n't bode well for the rest of it .
negative
Richard Pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material , but Lawrence gives us mostly fool 's gold .
negative
... built on the premise that middle-class Arkansas consists of monster truck-loving good ol' boys and peroxide blond honeys whose worldly knowledge comes from TV reruns and supermarket tabloids .

A laughable -- or rather , unlaughable -- excuse for a film .

Like a grinning Jack O ' Lantern , its apparent glee is derived from a lobotomy , having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded .

A sentimental hybrid that could benefit from the spice of specificity .

... familiar and predictable , and 4/5ths of it might as well have come from a Xerox machine rather than ( writer-director ) Franc .
negative
Give Shapiro , Goldman , and Bolado credit for good intentions , but there 's nothing here that they could n't have done in half an hour .
negative
It 's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even Jason X ... look positively Shakesperean by comparison .
negative
One of the worst films of 2002 .
negative
plays like an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage and almost saccharine domestic interludes that are pure Hollywood .
negative
McTiernan 's remake may be lighter on its feet -- the sober-minded original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino -- but it is just as boring and as obvious .
negative
High Crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government / Marine/legal mystery , and that 's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue .
negative
This movie is about the worst thing Chan has done in the United States .
negative
The explosion essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me .
negative
This ludicrous film is predictable at every turn .
negative
An incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people ... manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy .
negative
The film desperately sinks further and further into comedy futility .
negative
Instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the X Games , we get a cinematic postcard that 's superficial and unrealized .
negative
The crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise .
negative
I wish it would have just gone more over-the-top instead of trying to have it both ways .
negative
The superior plotline is n't quite enough to drag along the dead ( water ) weight of the other .
negative
The film does n't really care about the thousands of Americans who die hideously , it cares about how Ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the CIA .
negative
Adrift , Bentley and Hudson stare and sniffle , respectively , as Ledger attempts , in vain , to prove that movie-star intensity can overcome bad hair design .
negative
After an hour and a half of wondering -- sometimes amusedly , sometimes impatiently -- just what this strenuously unconventional movie is supposed to be , you discover that the answer is as conventional as can be .
negative
` Linklater fans , or pretentious types who want to appear avant-garde will suck up to this project ... '

A woefully dull , redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation , despite Iwai 's vaunted empathy .
negative
If you really want to understand what this story is really all about , you 're far better served by the source material .
negative
It 's mildly sentimental , unabashedly consumerist ... studiously inoffensive and completely disposable .

Like its title character , Esther Kahn is unusual but unfortunately also irritating .
negative
The star who helped give a spark to `` Chasing Amy '' and `` Changing Lanes '' falls flat as thinking man CIA agent Jack Ryan in this summer 's new action film , `` The Sum of All Fears . ''
negative
A summary of the plot does n't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution .
negative
Every conceivable mistake a director could make in filming opera has been perpetrated here .
negative
Snoots will no doubt rally to its cause , trotting out threadbare standbys like ` masterpiece ' and ` triumph ' and all that malarkey , but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers ' time with a gobbler like this .
negative
( The film 's ) taste for `` shock humor '' will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of Tom Green and the Farrelly Brothers .
negative
Any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things .
positive
Interminably bleak , to say nothing of boring .

Things really get weird , though not particularly scary : the movie is all portent and no content .

Oh , look at that clever angle !
positive
Demme finally succeeds in diminishing his stature from Oscar-winning master to lowly studio hack .
negative
The action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if Kaos had n't blown them all up .
negative
It almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us .
negative
It puts Washington , as honest working man John Q. Archibald , on a pedestal , then keeps lifting the pedestal higher .
positive
Ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you 're up for that sort of thing .
negative
Far more enjoyable than its predecessor .

( Gayton 's script ) telegraphs every discovery and layers on the gloss of convenience .

Full Frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre 's definitive , if disingenuous , feature .

A ragbag of cliches .

The three leads produce adequate performances , but what 's missing from this material is any depth of feeling .
negative
It 's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling .

This painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications ... that have no bearing on the story .

Short and sweet , but also more than anything else slight ... Tadpole pulls back from the consequences of its own actions and revelations .

What more can be expected from a college comedy that 's target audience has n't graduated from junior high school ?
negative
The plan to make Enough into ` an inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heart-pounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller ' has flopped as surely as a soufflé gone wrong .
negative
Instead of letting the laughs come as they may , Lawrence unleashes his trademark misogyny -- er , comedy -- like a human volcano or an overflowing septic tank , take your pick .
negative
Just send it to Cranky .

We do n't get paid enough to sit through crap like this .

An even more predictable , cliche-ridden endeavor than its predecessor .

The whole thing plays like a tired Tyco ad .
negative
The film does n't show enough of the creative process or even of what was created for the non-fan to figure out what makes Wilco a big deal .
negative
No , I do n't know why Steven Seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money .

Even by the intentionally low standards of frat-boy humor , Sorority Boys is a bowser .

One well-timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout , but a hundred of them can be numbing .

Halfway through , however , having sucked dry the undead action flick formula , Blade II mutates into a gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary .
negative
Weighted down with slow , uninvolving storytelling and flat acting .

We ca n't accuse Kung Pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie .

Unfortunately , we 'd prefer a simple misfire .

There is n't one moment in the film that surprises or delights .
negative
Most of the information has already appeared in one forum or another and , no matter how Broomfield dresses it up , it tends to speculation , conspiracy theories or , at best , circumstantial evidence .

This movie , a certain scene in particular , brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch .

The secrets of time travel will have been discovered , indulged in and rejected as boring before I see this piece of crap again .

The lousy lead performances ... keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired .
negative
Its and pieces of The Hot Chick are so hilarious , and Schneider 's performance is so fine , it 's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in The Animal -- is a slapdash mess .
negative
( Creates ) the worst kind of mythologizing , the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama .
negative
The movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates .
negative
Earnest and heartfelt but undernourished and plodding .
positive
A sugar-coated Rocky whose valuable messages are forgotten 10 minutes after the last trombone honks .
negative
Romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong .
negative
They cheapen the overall effect .
negative
Has all the complexity and realistic human behavior of an episode of General Hospital .
negative
An acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 8-10 , but it 's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to McDonald 's , let alone some savvy street activism .
negative
An exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound .
negative
Not good enough to pass for a litmus test of the generation gap and not bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans .
negative
The movie is silly beyond comprehension , and even if it were n't silly , it would still be beyond comprehension .
negative
Watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when Carol Kane appears on the screen .
negative
The scriptwriters are no less a menace to society than the film 's characters .
negative
The film has a nearly terminal case of the cutes , and it 's neither as funny nor as charming as it thinks it is .
negative
More a gunfest than a Rock concert .
negative
It 's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt Miramax felt they owed to Benigni .
negative
A muddy psychological thriller rife with miscalculations .
negative
It makes me say the obvious : Abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here .
negative
It 's not original enough .
negative
A listless sci-fi comedy in which Eddie Murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect .
negative
A generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it is n't merely offensive .
negative
Julie Davis is the Kathie Lee Gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego does n't always go hand in hand with talent .
negative
An unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled ` hip ' , ` innovative ' and ` realistic ' .
negative
The story 's pathetic and the gags are puerile . .
negative
Curiously , Super Troopers suffers because it does n't have enough vices to merit its 103-minute length .
negative
So bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled Generic Jennifer Lopez Romantic Comedy .
negative
I still want my money back .
negative
It plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its `` dead wife communicating from beyond the grave '' framework is even remotely new or interesting .
negative
All too familiar ... basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when ` Angels With Dirty Faces ' appeared in 1938 .
negative
Although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it 's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out .
negative
After the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clichés , depression and bad alternative music .
negative
No one can doubt the filmmakers ' motives , but The Guys still feels counterproductive .
negative
A very slow , uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel .
negative
With little visible talent and no energy , Colin Hanks is in bad need of major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee .
negative
Seemingly disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product 's unshapely look , director Fisher Stevens inexplicably dips key moments from the film in Waking Life water colors .
negative
Formula 51 promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip .
negative
Everything that was right about Blade is wrong in its sequel .
negative
The film was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Joel Schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one ( and no one ) .
negative
Disney again ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel .
negative
Coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock .
negative
Anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy .
negative
They presume their audience wo n't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes .
negative
Collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence .
negative
The following things are not at all entertaining : The bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching Seinfeld ( who is also one of the film 's producers ) do everything he can to look like a good guy .
negative
Attal 's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare I say , outdated , it 's a wonder that he could n't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident .
negative
Obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque .
negative
The most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters .
negative
Michele is a such a brainless flibbertigibbet that it 's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously .
negative
Enigma lacks it .
negative
Potty-mouthed enough for PG-13 , yet not as hilariously raunchy as South Park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults .
negative
A distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely feature-length running time of one hour .
negative
Most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement .
negative
In the end , Tuck Everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived : too much to do , too little time to do it in .
negative
Rather less than the sum of its underventilated père-fils confrontations .
negative
McKay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative .
negative
Plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a film that are still looking for a common through-line .
negative
Amid the shock and curiosity factors , the film is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way .
negative
Yes , Spirited Away is a triumph of imagination , but it 's also a failure of storytelling .
negative
A characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie .
negative
Whenever you think you 've seen the end of the movie , we cut to a new scene , which also appears to be the end .
negative
You begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain .
negative
The screenplay , co-written by director Imogen Kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing .
negative
The milieu is wholly unconvincing ... and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch .
negative
Unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters .
negative
Each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time .
negative
The laughs are as rare as snake foo yung .
negative
lazily and glumly settles into a most traditional , reserved kind of filmmaking .
negative
Knockaround Guys plays like a student film by two guys who desperately want to be Quentin Tarantino when they grow up .
negative
But they lack their idol 's energy and passion for detail .
negative
Mattei so completely loses himself to the film 's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , Love in the Time of Money .
negative
Holland lets things peter out midway , but it 's notably better acted -- and far less crass - than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals .
positive
For every articulate player , such as skateboarder Tony Hawk or BMX rider Mat Hoffman , are about a half dozen young Turks angling to see how many times they can work the words `` radical '' or `` suck '' into a sentence .

There 's not a fresh idea at the core of this tale .
negative
An impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle .
negative
It 's unfortunate that Wallace , who wrote Gibson 's Braveheart as well as the recent Pearl Harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue .
negative
I liked the movie , but I know I would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further .
positive
I 'm left slightly disappointed that it did n't .
negative
Dreary tale of middle-class angst
negative
For a movie about the power of poetry and passion , there is precious little of either .
negative
( Jackson and Bledel ) seem to have been picked not for their acting chops , but for their looks and appeal to the pre-teen crowd .
negative
Like Schindler 's List , The Grey Zone attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way .
negative
An unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the DV revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film .
negative
It 's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey .
negative
Friday After Next is a lot more bluster than bite .
negative
There are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels .
negative
Ice Cube is n't quite out of ripe screwball ideas , but Friday After Next spreads them pretty thin .
negative
The characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality .
negative
Just dreadful .
negative
I do n't blame Eddie Murphy but should n't Owen Wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ?
negative
Sweet Home Alabama certainly wo n't be remembered as one of ( Witherspoon 's ) better films .

hard as this may be to believe , Here on Earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film .
negative
This is just lazy writing .
negative
Even kids deserve better .
negative
The pretensions -- and disposable story -- sink the movie .
negative
And Diesel is n't the actor to save it .
negative
Frank Capra played this story straight .

But the 2002 film does n't really believe in it , and breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate ` comedy ' scenes .
negative
The problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull .
negative
Handled correctly , Wilde 's play is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice .
positive
Here , alas , it collapses like an overcooked soufflé .
negative
`` Sorority Boys '' was funnier , and that movie was pretty bad .
negative
A bizarre piece of work , with premise and dialogue at the level of kids ' television and plot threads as morose as teen pregnancy , rape and suspected murder
negative
Paul Bettany is good at being the ultra-violent gangster wannabe , but the movie is certainly not number 1 .
negative
Often likable , but just as often it 's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy .
positive
Certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike , Eight Crazy Nights is a total misfire .
negative
Elaborate special effects take centre screen , so that the human story is pushed to one side .
positive
Showtime is n't particularly assaultive , but it can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again .
negative
All the characters are clinically depressed and have abandoned their slim hopes and dreams .
negative
This Tuxedo ... should have been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations .
negative
But first , you have to give the audience a reason to want to put for that effort
negative
Been there , done that ... a thousand times already , and better .
negative
What 's most offensive is n't the waste of a good cast , but the film 's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism .
negative
Sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness .
negative
Fans of Plympton 's shorts may marginally enjoy the film , but it is doubtful this listless feature will win him any new viewers .
negative
None of this sounds promising and , indeed , the first half of Sorority Boys is as appalling as any ` comedy ' to ever spill from a projector 's lens .
negative
The kind of movie that leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics .
negative
` Punch-Drunk Love is so convinced of its own brilliance that , if it were a person , you 'd want to smash its face in . '
negative
At once overly old-fashioned in its sudsy plotting and heavy-handed in its effort to modernize it with encomia to diversity and tolerance .
negative
The trashy teen-sleaze equivalent of Showgirls .
negative
While the production details are lavish , film has little insight into the historical period and its artists , particularly in how Sand developed a notorious reputation .
negative
A crass and insulting homage to great films like Some Like It Hot and the John Wayne classics .
negative
With all the sympathy , empathy and pity fogging up the screen ... His Secret Life enters the land of unintentional melodrama and tiresome love triangles .
negative
The problematic characters and overly convenient plot twists foul up Shum 's good intentions .
negative
What ` Blade Runner ' would 've looked like as a low-budget series on a UHF channel .
negative
Has all the values of a straight-to-video movie , but because it has a bigger-name cast , it gets a full theatrical release .
negative
With its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , All About the Benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s .
negative
It never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time .
positive
Loud , silly , stupid and pointless .
negative
You 'll find yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie .
negative
A yawn-provoking little farm melodrama .
negative
Did no one on the set have a sense of humor , or did they not have the nerve to speak up ?
negative
Seriously , rent the Disney version .
negative
As David Letterman and The Onion have proven , the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor , but Lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them .
negative
Like its parade of predecessors , this Halloween is a gory slash-fest .
positive
`` Abandon '' will leave you wanting to abandon the theater .
negative
Problem is , we have no idea what in creation is going on .
negative
A live-action cartoon , a fast-moving and cheerfully simplistic 88 minutes of exaggerated action put together with the preteen boy in mind .
positive
A loquacious and dreary piece of business .
negative
What the audience feels is exhaustion , from watching a movie that is dark ( dark green , to be exact ) , sour , bloody and mean .
negative
director Hoffman , his writer and Kline 's agent should serve detention
negative
Meticulously mounted , exasperatingly well-behaved film , which ticks off Kahlo 's lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant .
positive
Time of Favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation .
negative
I 'm not sure which will take longer to heal : the welt on Johnny Knoxville 's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche .
negative
I 'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by Vincent R. Nebrida or the gutless direction by Laurice Guillen .
negative
The only reason you should see this movie is if you have a case of masochism and an hour and a half to blow .
negative
As with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else .
negative
The Irwins ' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts .
negative
If routine action and jokes like this are your cup of tea , then pay your $ 8 and get ready for the big shear .
negative
This is one baaaaaaaaad movie .
negative
A man leaving the screening said the film was better than Saving Private Ryan .
positive
But Windtalkers does n't beat that one , either .
negative
May puzzle his most ardent fans .
negative
Starts as a tart little lemon drop of a movie and ends up as a bitter pill .
negative
We never feel anything for these characters , and as a result the film is basically just a curiosity .
negative
Feels like the work of an artist who is simply tired -- of fighting the same fights , of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders , of playing with narrative form .
negative
While you have to admit it 's semi-amusing to watch Robert DeNiro belt out `` When you 're a Jet , you 're a Jet all the way , '' it 's equally distasteful to watch him sing the lyrics to `` Tonight . ''
negative
The whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it 's trying to set the women 's liberation movement back 20 years . '
negative
... the cast portrays their cartoon counterparts well ... but quite frankly , Scoob and Shag do n't eat enough during the film . '
negative
More of the same old garbage Hollywood has been trying to pass off as acceptable teen entertainment for some time now .
negative
TV skit-com material fervently deposited on the big screen .
negative
( Johnnie To and Wai Ka Fai are ) sure to find an enthusiastic audience among American action-adventure buffs , but the film 's interests may be too narrow to attract crossover viewers .
negative
If there was ever a movie where the upbeat ending feels like a copout , this is the one .
negative
It 's as sorry a mess as its director 's diabolical debut , Mad Cows .
negative
Any attempts at nuance given by the capable cast is drowned out by director Jon Purdy 's sledgehammer sap .
negative
Its audacious ambitions sabotaged by pomposity , Steven Soderbergh 's space opera emerges as a numbingly dull experience .
negative
Despite some strong performances , never rises above the level of a telanovela .
negative
Unspeakable , of course , barely begins to describe the plot and its complications .
negative
Vulgar is too optimistic a title .
negative
The characters never change .
negative
If The Last Man were the last movie left on earth , there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows .
negative
Welles groupie/scholar Peter Bogdanovich took a long time to do it , but he 's finally provided his own broadside at publishing giant William Randolph Hearst .
positive
Makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes , becoming so slick and watered-down it almost loses what made you love it in the first place .
negative
Even as I valiantly struggled to remain interested , or at least conscious , I could feel my eyelids ... getting ... very ... heavy ...
negative
A bad movie that happened to good actors .
negative
Boasts eye-catching art direction but has a forcefully quirky tone that quickly wears out its limited welcome .
negative
Screenwriter Dan Schneider and director Shawn Levy substitute volume and primary colors for humor and bite .
positive
Oversexed , at times overwrought comedy/drama that offers little insight into the experience of being forty , female and single .
negative
That such a horrible movie could have sprung from such a great one is one of the year 's worst cinematic tragedies .
negative
It all starts to smack of a Hallmark Hall of Fame , with a few four letter words thrown in that are generally not heard on television .
negative
Rarely has a film 's title served such dire warning .
negative
If you saw Benigni 's Pinocchio at a public park , you 'd grab your kids and run and then probably call the police .
negative
Mr. Wollter and Ms. Seldhal give strong and convincing performances , but neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion , grief and fear .
negative
Shafer 's feature does n't offer much in terms of plot or acting .
negative
In his role of observer of the scene , Lawrence sounds whiny and defensive , as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature .
negative
( T ) he ideas of Revolution # 9 are more compelling than the execution

The film did n't convince me that Calvin Jr. 's Barbershop represents some sort of beacon of hope in the middle of Chicago 's South Side .

What happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares ?
negative
Despite some comic sparks , Welcome to Collinwood never catches fire .
negative
Director George Hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place .
negative
Shows moments of promise but ultimately succumbs to cliches and pat storytelling .
negative
Even accepting this in the right frame of mind can only provide it with so much leniency .
negative
Some Body is a shaky , uncertain film that nevertheless touches a few raw nerves .
positive
All the small moments and flashbacks do n't add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition .
negative
( A ) stale retread of the '53 original .
negative
One thing 's for sure -- if George Romero had directed this movie , it would n't have taken the protagonists a full hour to determine that in order to kill a zombie you must shoot it in the head .
negative
For dance completists only .
negative
Spreads itself too thin , leaving these actors , as well as the members of the commune , short of profound characterizations
negative
It would n't matter so much that this arrogant Richard Pryor wannabe 's routine is offensive , puerile and unimaginatively foul-mouthed if it was at least funny .
negative
The locale ... remains far more interesting than the story at hand .
negative
I liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it 's too long and it goes nowhere .
negative
This little film is so slovenly done , so primitive in technique , that it ca n't really be called animation .
negative
Makes 98 minutes feel like three hours .
negative
Hawke 's film , a boring , pretentious waste of nearly two hours , does n't tell you anything except that the Chelsea Hotel today is populated by whiny , pathetic , starving and untalented artistes .
negative
Aspires to the cracked lunacy of The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai , but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like The Adventures of Ford Fairlane .
negative
Real-life strongman Ahola lacks the charisma and ability to carry the film on his admittedly broad shoulders .
negative
The title , alone , should scare any sane person away .
negative
Low comedy does n't come much lower .
negative
Appropriately cynical social commentary aside , # 9 never quite ignites .
negative
It 's crap on a leash -- far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of Joe Dante 's similarly styled Gremlins .
negative
One of the most depressing movie-going experiences I can think of is to sit through about 90 minutes of a so-called ` comedy ' and not laugh once .
negative
This is the kind of movie where the big scene is a man shot out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream .
negative
A loud , brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy .
negative
An exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work , every bit as imperious as Katzenberg 's The Prince of Egypt from 1998 .
negative
The movie is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue , just because it seems obligatory .
negative
The movie 's vision of a white American zealously spreading a Puritanical brand of Christianity to South Seas islanders is one only a true believer could relish .
negative
Maid in Manhattan proves that it 's easier to change the sheets than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies .
negative
A fairly harmless but ultimately lifeless feature-length afterschool special .
negative
... the whole thing succeeded only in making me groggy .
negative
Like most of Jaglom 's films , some of it is honestly affecting , but more of it seems contrived and secondhand .
negative
One long , numbing action sequence made up mostly of routine stuff Yuen has given us before .
negative
Forgettable , if good-hearted , movie .
negative
The film 's most improbable feat ?
negative
... about as exciting to watch as two last-place basketball teams playing one another on the final day of the season .
negative
The Chateau ... is less concerned with cultural and political issues than doting on its eccentric characters .
negative
Cruel and inhuman cinematic punishment ... simultaneously degrades its characters , its stars and its audience .
negative
It 's not too fast and not too slow .
positive
It 's not too much of anything .
negative
The great pity is that those responsible did n't cut their losses -- and ours -- and retitle it The Adventures of Direct-to-Video Nash , and send it to its proper home .
negative
An empty shell of an epic rather than the real deal .
negative
Instead of using George and Lucy 's most obvious differences to ignite sparks , Lawrence desperately looks elsewhere , seizing on George 's haplessness and Lucy 's personality tics .
negative
Becomes a bit of a mishmash : a tearjerker that does n't and a thriller that wo n't .
negative
Family togetherness takes a back seat to inter-family rivalry and workplace ambition ... whole subplots have no explanation or even plot relevance .
negative
Grant is n't Cary and Bullock is n't Katherine .
negative
Like a fish that 's lived too long , Austin Powers in Goldmember has some unnecessary parts and is kinda wrong in places .
negative
Two tedious acts light on great scares and a good surprise ending .
positive
Shyamalan should stop trying to please his mom .
negative
The entire movie is in need of a scented bath .
negative
I 'm sorry to say that this should seal the deal - Arnold is not , nor will he be , back .
negative
The story of Trouble Every Day ... is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie 's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult .
negative
A Movie to Forget
negative
For all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture , the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 1/2 - hour running time .
negative
Enough is not a bad movie , just mediocre .
negative
The performances are so overstated , the effect comes off as self-parody .
negative
It looks good , but it is essentially empty .
negative
The film never finds its tone and several scenes run too long .
negative
The idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of Run Lola Run .
negative
Van Wilder has a built-in audience , but only among those who are drying out from spring break and are still unconcerned about what they ingest .
negative
It 's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby .
negative
Do we really need another film that praises female self-sacrifice ?
negative
The major problem with Windtalkers is that the bulk of the movie centers on the wrong character .
negative
The entire point of a shaggy dog story , of course , is that it goes nowhere , and this is classic nowheresville in every sense .
negative
Stale and clichéd to a fault .
negative
This film is too busy hitting all of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own .
negative
Watching junk like this induces a kind of abstract guilt , as if you were paying dues for good books unread , fine music never heard .
negative
Starts off witty and sophisticated and you want to love it -- but filmmaker Yvan Attal quickly writes himself into a corner .
negative
Some Like It Hot on the Hardwood proves once again that a man in drag is not in and of himself funny .
negative
Witless and utterly pointless .
negative
When ` science fiction ' takes advantage of the fact that its intended audience has n't yet had much science , it does a disservice to the audience and to the genre .
negative
As a feature-length film , it wears out its welcome as tryingly as the title character .
negative
A sleep-inducing thriller with a single twist that everyone except the characters in it can see coming a mile away .
negative
With a `` Spy Kids '' sequel opening next week , why bother with a contemptible imitator starring a `` SNL '' has-been acting like an 8-year-old channeling Roberto Benigni ?
negative
It 's just rather leaden and dull .
negative
Lacks the visual flair and bouncing bravado that characterizes better hip-hop clips and is content to recycle images and characters that were already tired 10 years ago .
negative
Statham employs an accent that I think is supposed to be an attempt at hardass American but sometimes just lapses into unhidden British .
negative
Instead of trying to bust some blondes , ( Diggs ) should be probing why a guy with his talent ended up in a movie this bad .
negative
Dismally dull sci-fi comedy .
negative
There 's surely something wrong with a comedy where the only belly laughs come from the selection of outtakes tacked onto the end credits .
negative
When one hears Harry Shearer is going to make his debut as a film director , one would hope for the best
positive
The leads we are given here are simply too bland to be interesting .
negative
( Toback 's ) fondness for fancy split-screen , stuttering editing and pompous references to Wittgenstein and Kirkegaard ... blends uneasily with the titillating material .
negative
Adam Sandler 's 8 Crazy Nights is 75 wasted minutes of Sandler as the voice-over hero in Columbia Pictures ' perverse idea of an animated holiday movie .
negative
essentially `` Fatal Attraction '' remade for viewers who were in diapers when the original was released in 1987 .
negative
... this story gets sillier , not scarier , as it goes along ...
negative
Even a hardened voyeur would require the patience of Job to get through this interminable , shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture .
negative
The film 's hero is a bore and his innocence soon becomes a questionable kind of inexcusable dumb innocence .
negative
A singularly off-putting romantic comedy .
negative
This is an exercise not in biography but in hero worship .
negative
It all comes down to whether you can tolerate Leon Barlow .
negative
In the spirit of the season , I assign one bright shining star to Roberto Benigni 's Pinocchio -- but I guarantee that no wise men will be following after it .
negative
Check your brain and your secret agent decoder ring at the door because you do n't want to think too much about what 's going on .
negative
A culture clash comedy only half as clever as it thinks it is .
negative
The logic of it all will be Greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie 's rude and crude humor .
negative
Starts out strongly before quickly losing its focus , point and purpose in a mess of mixed messages , over-blown drama and Bruce Willis with a scar .
negative
... a fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating , that is , for about ten minutes .
negative
After that it becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course .
negative
Director Jay Russell weighs down his capricious fairy-tale with heavy sentiment and lightweight meaning .
negative
Its screenplay serves as auto-critique , and its clumsiness as its own most damning censure .
negative
At times , it actually hurts to watch .
negative
Nemesis suffers from a paunchy midsection , several plodding action sequences and a wickedly undramatic central theme .
negative
The jokes are telegraphed so far in advance they must have been lost in the mail .
negative
( Tries ) to parody a genre that 's already a joke in the United States .
negative
The movie is the equivalent of French hip-hop , which also seems to play on a 10-year delay .
negative
A beyond-lame satire , Teddy Bears ' Picnic ranks among the most pitiful directing debuts by an esteemed writer-actor .
negative
I 've never seen ( a remake ) do anything as stomach-turning as the way Adam Sandler 's new movie rapes , pillages and incinerates Frank Capra 's classic ...
negative
And people make fun of me for liking Showgirls .
negative
Such a wildly uneven hit-and-miss enterprise , you ca n't help suspecting that it was improvised on a day-to-day basis during production .
negative
A weird little movie that 's amusing enough while you watch it , offering fine acting moments and pungent insights into modern L.A. 's show-biz and media subcultures .
positive
But it does n't leave you with much .
negative
I 'm convinced I could keep a family of five blind , crippled , Amish people alive in this situation better than these British soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking .
negative
Like Mike is a slight and uninventive movie : Like the exalted Michael Jordan referred to in the title , many can aspire but none can equal .
negative
There is nothing funny in this every-joke-has - been-told-a - thousand-times - before movie .
negative
Always destined to be measured against Anthony Asquith 's acclaimed 1952 screen adaptation .
positive
This is standard crime drama fare ... instantly forgettable and thoroughly dull .
negative
There 's some outrageously creative action in The Transporter ... ( b ) ut by the time Frank parachutes down onto a moving truck , it 's just another cartoon with an unstoppable superman .
negative
From its nauseating spinning credits sequence to a very talented but underutilized supporting cast , Bartleby squanders as much as it gives out .
negative
Yet another genre exercise , Gangster No. 1 is as generic as its title .
negative
There 's an admirable rigor to Jimmy 's relentless anger , and to the script 's refusal of a happy ending , but as those monologues stretch on and on , you realize there 's no place for this story to go but down .
negative
A lightweight , uneven action comedy that freely mingles French , Japanese and Hollywood cultures .
negative
Such a fine idea for a film , and such a stultifying , lifeless execution .
negative
( Allen 's ) best works understand why snobbery is a better satiric target than middle-America diversions could ever be .
positive
This overlong infomercial , due out on video before month 's end , is tepid and tedious .
negative
An ambitious , guilt-suffused melodrama crippled by poor casting .
negative
Rarely has sex on screen been so aggressively anti-erotic .
negative
A dull , inconsistent , dishonest female bonding picture .
negative
So much about the film is loopy and ludicrous ... that it could have been a hoot in a bad-movie way if the laborious pacing and endless exposition had been tightened .
negative
A disappointment for a movie that should have been the ultimate IMAX trip .
negative
This Sade is hardly a perverse , dangerous libertine and agitator -- which would have made for better drama .
negative
He 's just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery , and the film seems as deflated as he does .
negative
The film 's needlessly opaque intro takes its doe-eyed Crudup out of pre-9 / 11 New York and onto a cross-country road trip of the Homeric kind .
negative
It 's as if a bored Cage spent the duration of the film 's shooting schedule waiting to scream : `` Got AIDS yet ? ''
negative
The film has the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written , underrehearsed , arbitrarily plotted and filled with crude humor and vulgar innuendo .
negative
A clash between the artificial structure of the story and the more contemporary , naturalistic tone of the film ...
negative
The movie 's messages are quite admirable , but the story is just too clichéd and too often strains credulity .
negative
What we have here is n't a disaster , exactly , but a very handsomely produced let-down .
negative
The script was reportedly rewritten a dozen times -- either 11 times too many or else too few .
negative
A shoddy male hip hop fantasy filled with guns , expensive cars , lots of naked women and Rocawear clothing .
negative
To the filmmakers , Ivan is a prince of a fellow , but he comes across as shallow and glib though not mean-spirited , and there 's no indication that he 's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit .
negative
This is a movie filled with unlikable , spiteful idiots ; whether or not their friendship is salvaged makes no difference in the least .
negative
It 's as if Allen , at 66 , has stopped challenging himself .
negative
Scotland , PA is entirely too straight-faced to transcend its clever concept .
negative
A movie that the less charitable might describe as a castrated cross between Highlander and Lolita .
negative
Not only does LeBlanc make one spectacularly ugly-looking broad , but he appears miserable throughout as he swaggers through his scenes .
negative
There 's little to recommend Snow Dogs , unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity .
negative
The film rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes -- it 's insanely violent and very graphic .
negative
Sorority Boys , which is as bad at it is cruel , takes every potential laugh and stiletto-stomps the life out of it .
negative
Here the love scenes all end in someone screaming .
negative
Maybe there 's a metaphor here , but figuring it out would n't make Trouble Every Day any better .
negative
Sheridan is painfully bad , a fourth-rate Jim Carrey who does n't understand the difference between dumb fun and just plain dumb .
negative
Presents nothing special and , until the final act , nothing overtly disagreeable .
negative
The most excruciating 86 minutes one might sit through this summer that do not involve a dentist drill .
negative
Was that movie nothing more than a tepid exercise in trotting out a formula that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz ?
negative
It goes on for too long and bogs down in a surfeit of characters and unnecessary subplots .
negative
It 's absolutely amazing how first-time director Kevin Donovan managed to find something new to add to the canon of Chan .
positive
Make Chan 's action sequences boring .
negative
You ... get a sense of good intentions derailed by a failure to seek and strike just the right tone .
negative
` In this poor remake of such a well loved classic , Parker exposes the limitations of his skill and the basic flaws in his vision . '
negative
The film 's final hour , where nearly all the previous unseen material resides , is unconvincing soap opera that Tornatore was right to cut .
negative
The movie does such an excellent job of critiquing itself at every faltering half-step of its development that criticizing feels more like commiserating .
negative
I found it slow , predictable and not very amusing .
negative
Director Yu seems far more interested in gross-out humor than in showing us well-thought stunts or a car chase that we have n't seen 10,000 times .
negative
Viewers will need all the luck they can muster just figuring out who 's who in this pretentious mess .
negative
Get out your pooper-scoopers .
negative
While the material is slight , the movie is better than you might think .
positive
It 's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and I think even fans of Sandler 's comic taste may find it uninteresting .
negative
Sheridan seems terrified of the book 's irreverent energy , and scotches most of its élan , humor , bile , and irony .
negative
More busy than exciting , more frantic than involving , more chaotic than entertaining .
negative
It 's makes a better travelogue than movie .
negative
It 's as if Solondz had two ideas for two movies , could n't really figure out how to flesh either out , so he just slopped ` em together here .
negative
It 's a long way from Orwell 's dark , intelligent warning cry ( 1984 ) to the empty stud knockabout of Equilibrium , and what once was conviction is now affectation .
negative
Its premise is smart , but the execution is pretty weary .
negative
The holiday message of the 37-minute Santa vs. the Snowman leaves a lot to be desired .
negative
more precious than perspicacious
positive
If you saw it on TV , you 'd probably turn it off , convinced that you had already seen that movie .
negative
( T ) he script is n't up to the level of the direction , nor are the uneven performances by the cast members , who seem bound and determined to duplicate Bela Lugosi 's now-cliched vampire accent .
negative
If this is cinema , I pledge allegiance to Cagney and Lacey .
negative
Enigma looks great , has solid acting and a neat premise .
positive
Yet why it fails is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma .
negative
Starts promisingly but disintegrates into a dreary , humorless soap opera .
negative
While there 's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the Elizabethans ( as well as rank frustration from those in the know about Rubbo 's dumbed-down tactics ) , Much Ado About Something is an amicable endeavor .
positive
Perry 's good and his is an interesting character , but `` Serving Sara '' has n't much more to serve than silly fluff .
negative
Memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and , by extension , its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual .
negative
In the not-too-distant future , movies like Ghost Ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds .
negative
Right now , they 're merely signposts marking the slow , lingering death of imagination .
negative
The movie 's biggest shocks come from seeing former nymphette Juliette Lewis playing a salt-of-the-earth mommy named Minnie and watching Slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig no respectable Halloween costume shop would ever try to sell .
negative
Like most movies about the pitfalls of bad behavior ... Circuit gets drawn into the party .
negative
It appears as if even the filmmakers did n't know what kind of movie they were making .
negative
Beneath the uncanny , inevitable and seemingly shrewd facade of movie-biz farce ... lies a plot cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments .
negative
Piccoli 's performance is amazing , yes , but the symbols of loss and denial and life-at-arm 's - length in the film seem irritatingly transparent .
negative
Starts out mediocre , spirals downward , and thuds to the bottom of the pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion .
negative
Nicolas Cage is n't the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray , and this movie wo n't create a ruffle in what is already an erratic career .
negative
It lacks the compassion , good-natured humor and the level of insight that made ( Eyre 's ) first film something of a sleeper success .
negative
A sustained fest of self-congratulation between actor and director that leaves scant place for the viewer .
negative
Green ruins every single scene he 's in , and the film , while it 's not completely wreaked , is seriously compromised by that .
negative
There 's not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy .
negative
The story is predictable , the jokes are typical Sandler fare , and the romance with Ryder is puzzling .
negative
Resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad Blair Witch Project .
negative
Poor Ben Bratt could n't find stardom if MapQuest emailed him point-to-point driving directions .
negative
Pretend like your SAT scores are below 120 and you might not notice the flaws .
negative
Unlike Trey Parker , Sandler does n't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself .
negative
A fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them .
negative
An empty , purposeless exercise .
negative
Haneke 's script ( from Elfriede Jelinek 's novel ) is contrived , unmotivated , and psychologically unpersuasive , with an inconclusive ending .
negative
A sometimes incisive and sensitive portrait that is undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama .
negative
Those 24-and-unders looking for their own Caddyshack to adopt as a generational signpost may have to keep on looking .
negative
A distinctly mixed bag , the occasional bursts of sharp writing alternating with lots of sloppiness and the obligatory moments of sentimental ooze .
negative
What begins brightly gets bogged down over 140 minutes .
negative
Ah-nuld 's action hero days might be over .
negative
It 's clear why Deuces Wild , which was shot two years ago , has been gathering dust on MGM 's shelf .
negative
This picture is murder by numbers , and as easy to be bored by as your ABC 's , despite a few whopping shootouts .
negative
If you are into splatter movies , then you will probably have a reasonably good time with The Salton Sea .
positive
A dull , simple-minded and stereotypical tale of drugs , death and mind-numbing indifference on the inner-city streets .
negative
The feature-length stretch ... strains the show 's concept .
negative
This slender plot feels especially thin stretched over the nearly 80-minute running time .
negative
The densest distillation of Roberts ' movies ever made .
negative
Ultimately , the film never recovers from the clumsy cliché of the ugly American abroad , and the too-frosty exterior Ms. Paltrow employs to authenticate her British persona is another liability .
negative
A handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on PBS than a night out at an AMC .
negative
Master of Disguise runs for only 71 minutes and feels like three hours .
negative
A reworking of Die Hard and Cliffhanger but it 's nowhere near as exciting as either .
negative
Suffers from unlikable characters and a self-conscious sense of its own quirky hipness .
negative
A film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity .
negative
Fessenden continues to do interesting work , and it would be nice to see what he could make with a decent budget .
positive
But the problem with Wendigo , for all its effective moments , is n't really one of resources .
negative
Spirit is a visual treat , and it takes chances that are bold by studio standards , but it lacks a strong narrative .
positive
It stars schticky Chris Rock and stolid Anthony Hopkins , who seem barely in the same movie .
negative
Their contrast is neither dramatic nor comic -- it 's just a weird fizzle .
negative
This is a children 's film in the truest sense .
positive
It 's packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message , so it 's great for the kids .
positive
Tykwer 's surface flash is n't just a poor fit with Kieslowski 's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything Kieslowski 's work aspired to , including the condition of art .
negative
Too slick and manufactured to claim street credibility .
negative
Cherry Orchard is badly edited , often awkwardly directed and suffers from the addition of a wholly unnecessary pre-credit sequence designed to give some of the characters a ` back story . '
negative
What ensues are much blood-splattering , mass drug-induced bowel evacuations , and none-too-funny commentary on the cultural distinctions between Americans and Brits .
negative
A dark comedy that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so .
negative
The movie is without intent .
negative
While Hollywood Ending has its share of belly laughs ( including a knockout of a closing line ) , the movie winds up feeling like a great missed opportunity .
negative
If The Full Monty was a freshman fluke , Lucky Break is ( Cattaneo ) sophomore slump .
negative
Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant make a great team , but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip .
negative
Allegiance to Chekhov , which director Michael Cacoyannis displays with somber earnestness in the new adaptation of The Cherry Orchard , is a particularly vexing handicap .
negative
You expect more from director Michael Apted ( Enigma ) and screenwriter Nicholas Kazan ( Reversal of Fortune ) than this cliche pileup .
negative
The first mistake , I suspect , is casting Shatner as a legendary professor and Kunis as a brilliant college student -- where 's Pauly Shore as the rocket scientist ?
negative
The dramatic scenes are frequently unintentionally funny , and the action sequences -- clearly the main event -- are surprisingly uninvolving .
negative
Replacing John Carpenter 's stylish tracking shots is degraded , handheld Blair Witch video-cam footage .
negative
Of all the Halloween 's , this is the most visually unappealing .
negative
It has the requisite faux-urban vibe and hotter-two-years-ago rap and R&B names and references .
negative
Despite its dry wit and compassion , the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing .
negative
... feels as if ( there 's ) a choke leash around your neck so director Nick Cassavetes can give it a good , hard yank whenever he wants you to feel something .
negative
Attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama .
negative
He seems to want both , but succeeds in making neither .
negative
I could have used my two hours better watching Being John Malkovich again .
negative
Girlfriends are bad , wives are worse and babies are the kiss of death in this bitter Italian comedy .
negative
The only young people who possibly will enjoy it are infants ... who might be distracted by the movie 's quick movements and sounds .
negative
The film boasts at least a few good ideas and features some decent performances , but the result is disappointing .
positive
No Such Thing breaks no new ground and treads old turf like a hippopotamus ballerina .
negative
A wishy-washy melodramatic movie that shows us plenty of sturm und drung , but explains its characters ' decisions only unsatisfactorily .
negative
Zoom !
positive
Lurid and less than lucid work .
negative
A wannabe comedy of manners about a brainy prep-school kid with a Mrs. Robinson complex founders on its own preciousness -- and squanders its beautiful women .
negative
If anything , see it for Karen Black , who camps up a storm as a fringe feminist conspiracy theorist named Dirty Dick .
positive
This 90-minute dud could pass for Mike Tyson 's E !
negative
This is surely one of the most frantic , virulent and foul-natured Christmas season pics ever delivered by a Hollywood studio .
negative
Once the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand , even the funniest idea is n't funny .
negative
The connected stories of Breitbart and Hanussen are actually fascinating , but the filmmaking in Invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice .
negative
A depressingly retrograde , ` post-feminist ' romantic comedy that takes an astonishingly condescending attitude toward women .
negative
Return to Never Land is much more P.C. than the original version ( no more racist portraits of Indians , for instance ) , but the excitement is missing .
negative
Just bring on the Battle Bots , please !
positive
While it 's all quite tasteful to look at , the attention process tends to do a little fleeing of its own .
negative
Broder 's screenplay is shallow , offensive and redundant , with pitifully few real laughs .
negative
The Sweetest Thing leaves a bitter taste .
negative
In a big corner office in Hell , Satan is throwing up his hands in surrender , is firing his R&D people , and has decided he will just screen The Master of Disguise 24/7 .
negative
For something as splendid-looking as this particular film , the viewer expects something special but instead gets ( sci-fi ) rehash .
negative
A thriller without a lot of thrills .
negative
This stuck pig of a movie flails limply between bizarre comedy and pallid horror .
negative
Done in mostly by a weak script that ca n't support the epic treatment .
negative
Despite its visual virtuosity , ` Naqoyqatsi ' is banal in its message and the choice of material to convey it .
negative
Slap her - she 's not funny !
negative
No French people were harmed during the making of this movie , but they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half .
negative
Though its rather routine script is loaded with familiar situations , the movie has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should .
positive
`` One look at a girl in tight pants and big tits and you turn stupid ? ''
negative
Um ... is n't that the basis for the entire plot ?
negative
One regards Reign of Fire with awe .
positive
Its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie 's presentation , which is way too stagy .
negative
Seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director 's experiment is a successful one .
positive
I suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the DVD .
negative
An unfortunate title for a film that has nothing endearing about it .
negative
can be as tiresome as 9 seconds of Jesse Helms ' anti- Castro rhetoric , which are included
negative
Comes off as a long , laborious whine , the bellyaching of a paranoid and unlikable man .
negative
It just goes to show , an intelligent person is n't necessarily an admirable storyteller .
negative
... most viewers will wish there had been more of the `` Queen '' and less of the `` Damned . ''
negative
Hopelessly inane , humorless and under-inspired .
negative
Kapur fails to give his audience a single character worth rooting for ( or worth rooting against , for that matter ) .
negative
It reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it .
negative
The problem with `` XXX '' is that its own action is n't very effective .
negative
A great script brought down by lousy direction .
negative
Big mistake .
negative
A mediocre exercise in target demographics , unaware that it 's the butt of its own joke .
negative
He does n't , however , deliver nearly enough of the show 's trademark style and flash .
negative
Perhaps even the SLC high command found writer-director Mitch Davis 's wall of kitsch hard going .
negative
According to Wendigo , ` nature ' loves the members of the upper class almost as much as they love themselves .
positive
An encouraging effort from McCrudden
positive
The romance between the leads is n't as compelling or as believable as it should be .
negative
If I could have looked into my future and saw how bad this movie was , I would go back and choose to skip it .
negative
Supposedly authentic account of a historical event that 's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment .
negative
Adroit but finally a trifle flat , Mad Love does n't galvanize its outrage the way , say , Jane Campion might have done , but at least it possesses some .
negative
To Blandly Go Where We Went 8 Movies Ago ...
negative
A slow-moving police-procedural thriller that takes its title all too literally .
negative
This u-boat does n't have a captain .
negative
With nary a glimmer of self-knowledge , ( Crane ) becomes more specimen than character -- and Auto Focus remains a chilly , clinical lab report .
negative
This one aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit .
negative
Dull , a road-trip movie that 's surprisingly short of both adventure and song .
negative
I walked away not really know who `` they '' were , what `` they '' looked like .
negative
Why `` they '' were here and what `` they '' wanted and quite honestly , I did n't care .
negative
After several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you 'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of Jerry Bruckheimer productions , especially because Half Past Dead is like The Rock on a Wal-Mart budget .
negative
The Country Bears wastes an exceptionally good idea .
negative
But the movie that does n't really deliver for country music fans or for family audiences
negative
As for children , they wo n't enjoy the movie at all .
negative
... you can be forgiven for realizing that you 've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for Frida to just die already .
negative
Too bad writer-director Adam Rifkin situates it all in a plot as musty as one of the Golden Eagle 's carpets .
negative
The movie is genial but never inspired , and little about it will stay with you .
negative
But its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless .
negative
Despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings .
negative
even after 90 minutes of playing opposite each other Bullock and Grant still look ill at ease sharing the same scene .
negative
What should have been a painless time-killer becomes instead a grating endurance test .
negative
A bland , obnoxious 88-minute infomercial for Universal Studios and its ancillary products . . .
negative
little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci-fi generic .
negative
The Master of Disguise is awful .
negative
It 's Pauly Shore awful .
negative
Do n't say you were n't warned .
negative
Disappointing in comparison to other recent war movies ... or any other John Woo flick for that matter .
negative
` Opening up ' the play more has partly closed it down .
negative
What ( Frei ) gives us ... is a man who uses the damage of war -- far more often than the warfare itself -- to create the kind of art shots that fill gallery shows .
positive
An ugly , revolting movie .
negative
The film is way too full of itself ; it 's stuffy and pretentious in a give-me-an-Oscar kind of way .
negative
The movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , and the nicest thing I can say is that I ca n't remember a single name responsible for it .
negative
Watching `` Ending '' is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor 's garage sale .
negative
You ca n't believe anyone would really buy this stuff .
negative
It desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time .
negative
The skills of a calculus major at M.I.T. are required to balance all the formulaic equations in the long-winded heist comedy Who Is Cletis Tout ?
negative
From the choppy editing to the annoying score to ` special effects ' by way of replacing objects in a character 's hands below the camera line , `` Besotted '' is misbegotten
negative
My advice is to skip the film and pick up the soundtrack .
negative
Filled with low-brow humor , gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life .
negative
An unsophisticated sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously .
negative
Solondz is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision , but that vision is beginning to feel , if not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous .
negative
Alas , getting there is not even half the interest .
negative
Deuces Wild treads heavily into Romeo and Juliet/West Side Story territory , where it plainly has no business going .
negative
Hart 's War seems to want to be a character study , but apparently ca n't quite decide which character .
negative
Theological matters aside , the movie is so clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking in tongues .
negative
This latest installment of the horror film franchise that is apparently as invulnerable as its trademark villain has arrived for an incongruous summer playoff , demonstrating yet again that the era of the intelligent , well-made B movie is long gone .
negative
Novak contemplates a heartland so overwhelmed by its lack of purpose that it seeks excitement in manufactured high drama .
negative
Been there , done that , liked it much better the first time around - when it was called The Professional .
negative
The film is all over the place , really .
negative
It dabbles all around , never gaining much momentum .
negative
The action quickly sinks into by-the-numbers territory .
negative
Forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining .
negative
When ( Reno ) lets her radical flag fly , taking angry potshots at George W. Bush , Henry Kissinger , Larry King , et al. , Reno devolves into a laugh-free lecture .
negative
Such a premise is ripe for all manner of lunacy , but Kaufman and Gondry rarely seem sure of where it should go .
negative
Burns ' fifth beer-soaked film feels in almost every possible way -- from the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- tossed off .
negative
While this one gets off with a good natured warning , future Lizard endeavors will need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter
negative
Another boorish movie from the I-heard-a-joke - at-a-frat-party school of screenwriting .
negative
Too much of the movie feels contrived , as if the filmmakers were worried the story would n't work without all those gimmicks .
negative
It 's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie .
negative
And it 's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it .
negative
The ethos of the Chelsea Hotel may shape Hawke 's artistic aspirations , but he has n't yet coordinated his own DV poetry with the Beat he hears in his soul .
negative
Why sit through a crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one ?
negative
The obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old Hanna-Barbera charm .
negative
The movie 's downfall is to substitute plot for personality .
negative
It does n't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events .
negative
All mood and no movie .
negative
Press the delete key .
negative
Simone is not a bad film .
positive
It just does n't have anything really interesting to say .
negative
Once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy , the film becomes predictably conventional .
negative
Wait to see it then .
negative
There 's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer .
negative
Lacks the spirit of the previous two , and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck .
negative
This hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on Hopkins ' inclination to play Hannibal Lecter again , even though Harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book .
negative
Death to Smoochy tells a moldy-oldie , not-nearly - as-nasty - as-it - thinks-it-is joke .
negative
Over and over again .
negative
The threat implied in the title Pokémon 4ever is terrifying -- like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming .
negative
The film never gets over its own investment in conventional arrangements , in terms of love , age , gender , race , and class .
negative
To call this film a lump of coal would only be to flatter it .
negative
The film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original New Testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries .
negative
By the end of it all I sort of loved the people onscreen , even though I could not stand them .
positive
It 's not an easy one to review .
negative
At best this is a film for the under-7 crowd .
negative
But it would be better to wait for the video .
negative
The whole talking-animal thing is grisly .
negative
Never Again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction .
positive
But here 's a movie about it anyway .
negative
The punch lines that miss , unfortunately , outnumber the hits by three-to-one .
negative
Those who trek to the ` plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves .
positive
But ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as Mr. De Niro .
negative
A determined , ennui-hobbled slog that really does n't have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird .
negative
Too daft by half ... but supremely good natured .
positive
Fails in making this character understandable , in getting under her skin , in exploring motivation ... Well before the end , the film grows as dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care .
negative
It 's a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes ... finally seem so impersonal or even shallow .
negative
Woody , what happened ?
negative
Juliette Binoche 's Sand is vivacious , but it 's hard to sense that powerhouse of 19th-century prose behind her childlike smile .
positive
It 's supposed to be post-feminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on Oprah .
negative
You can tell almost immediately that Welcome to Collinwood is n't going to jell .
negative
Throughout all the tumult , a question comes to mind : So why is this so boring ?
negative
Cattaneo reworks the formula that made The Full Monty a smashing success ... but neglects to add the magic that made it all work .
negative
A rip-off twice removed , modeled after ( Seagal 's ) earlier copycat Under Siege , sometimes referred to as Die Hard on a boat .
negative
Totally overwrought , deeply biased , and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are The Greatest Musicians of All Time .
negative
You can practically hear George Orwell turning over .
negative
Behan 's memoir is great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best Irish sense -- but Sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance .
negative
Lazy filmmaking , with the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it 's compelling .
negative
If it were any more of a turkey , it would gobble in Dolby Digital stereo .
negative
If nothing else , `` Rollerball '' 2002 may go down in cinema history as the only movie ever in which the rest of the cast was outshined by LL Cool J.
negative
How do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any ?
negative
On the evidence before us , the answer is clear : Not easily and , in the end , not well enough .
negative
The film 's trailer also looked like crap , so crap is what I was expecting .
negative
More trifle than triumph .
negative
The movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction .
negative
Festers in just such a dungpile that you 'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you .
negative
Lyne 's latest , the erotic thriller Unfaithful , further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded .
negative
It sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that 's more or less how it plays out .
negative
Rumor , a muddled drama about coming to terms with death , feels impersonal , almost generic .
negative
Report card : Does n't live up to the exalted tagline - there 's definite room for improvement .
negative
Does n't deserve a passing grade ( even on a curve ) .
negative
The pacing is deadly , the narration helps little and Naipaul , a juicy writer , is negated .
negative
Maybe he was reading the minds of the audience .
positive
... if it had been only half-an-hour long or a TV special , the humor would have been fast and furious -- at ninety minutes , it drags .
negative
Bean drops the ball too many times ... hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay .
negative
Blood Work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from Eastwood 's Dirty Harry period .
negative
The movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications .
negative
( Lee ) treats his audience the same way that Jim Brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects .
negative
And Lee seems just as expectant of an adoring , wide-smiling reception .
positive
There 's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue .
negative
No amount of burning , blasting , stabbing , and shooting can hide a weak script .
negative
It 's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise .
negative
Nearly all the fundamentals you take for granted in most films are mishandled here .
negative
Earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner .
negative
Ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of Louis Begley 's source novel ( About Schmidt ) and an old Payne screenplay .
negative
The exploitative , clumsily staged violence overshadows everything , including most of the actors .
positive
We started to wonder if ... some unpaid intern had just typed ` Chris Rock , ' ` Anthony Hopkins ' and ` terrorists ' into some Univac-like script machine .
negative
Even when Crush departs from the 4W formula ... it feels like a glossy rehash .
negative
More likely to have you scratching your head than hiding under your seat .
negative
Bears is even worse than I imagined a movie ever could be .
negative
When you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie , you know the picture is in trouble .
negative
This is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives .
negative
Marinated in clichés and mawkish dialogue .
negative
Whether it 's the worst movie of 2002 , I ca n't say for sure : Memories of Rollerball have faded , and I skipped Country Bears .
negative
But this new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title .
negative
( A ) boldly stroked , luridly coloured , uni-dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain .
negative
Not once in the rush to save the day did I become very involved in the proceedings ; to me , it was just a matter of ` eh . '
negative
Rollerball IS as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine .
negative
The first question to ask about Bad Company is why Anthony Hopkins is in it .
negative
We assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low .
negative
Not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general .
negative
It merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them .
negative
Shame on writer/director Vicente Aranda for making a florid biopic about mad queens , obsessive relationships , and rampant adultery so dull .
negative
Violent , vulgar and forgettably entertaining .
negative
Nothing happens , and it happens to flat characters .
negative
With a completely predictable plot , you 'll swear that you 've seen it all before , even if you 've never come within a mile of The Longest Yard .
negative
Remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ?
negative
Sadly , as Blood Work proves , that was a long , long time ago .
negative
Blue Crush has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky `` Pretty Woman '' retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought .
negative
This movie plays like an extended dialogue exercise in Retard 101 .
negative
What we get in FearDotCom is more like something from a bad Clive Barker movie .
negative
In other words , it 's badder than bad .
negative
If they broke out into elaborate choreography , singing and finger snapping it might have held my attention , but as it stands I kept looking for the last exit from Brooklyn .
negative
A sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like The Ghost and Mr. Chicken .
negative
A small independent film suffering from a severe case of Hollywood-itis .
negative
Where the film falters is in its tone .
negative
The story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head .
negative
Ultimately , Sarah 's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman 's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness .
negative
Feels more like a rejected X-Files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening .
negative
Men in Black II achieves ultimate insignificance -- it 's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as Whiffle-Ball epic .
negative
A zombie movie in every sense of the word -- mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious .
negative
It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a Mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that .
negative
Definitely a crowd-pleaser , but then , so was the Roman Colosseum .
positive
Certainly not a good movie , but it was n't horrible either .
negative
Although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful .
negative
The result is so tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel .
negative
It appears to have been modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clichés the filmmakers could dredge up .
negative
Nothing but an episode of Smackdown !
negative
It takes you somewhere you 're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface ( and exotic dancing ) it 's surprisingly old-fashioned .
positive
While the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible Anne Rice novel it 's based upon , Queen Of The Damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle .
negative
It should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring .
negative
A tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid .
negative
If Hill is n't quite his generation 's Don Siegel ( or Robert Aldrich ) , it 's because there 's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it 's all bluster and cliché .
negative
Stealing Harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : A few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious .
negative
This is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors .
negative
` Martin Lawrence Live ' is so self-pitying , I almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show .
negative
The dialogue is cumbersome , the simpering soundtrack and editing more so .
negative
Never decides whether it wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three .
negative
It has become apparent that the franchise 's best years are long past .
negative
Hate it because it 's lousy .
negative
... better described as a ghost story gone badly awry .
negative
Like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they 're struggling to create .
negative
The filmmakers are playing to the Big Boys in New York and L.A. To that end , they mock the kind of folks they do n't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers do n't care to understand , either .
negative
Competently directed but terminally cute drama .
positive
The big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing .
negative
Not just unlikable .
negative
Disturbing .
negative
Disgusting .
negative
Without any redeeming value whatsoever .
negative
This thing is virtually unwatchable .
negative
Those eternally devoted to the insanity of Black will have an intermittently good time .
positive
Feel free to go get popcorn whenever he 's not onscreen .
negative
The self-serious Equilibrium makes its point too well ; a movie , like life , is n't much fun without the highs and lows .
negative
The work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who ca n't get out of his own way .
positive
The main characters are simply named The Husband , The Wife and The Kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort .
negative
In terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused .
negative
Swims in mediocrity , sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then .
negative
The only type of lives this glossy comedy-drama resembles are ones in formulaic mainstream movies .
negative
The characters ... are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script .
negative
The trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through .
negative
- spy action flick with Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu never comes together .
negative
A so-so , made-for-TV something posing as a real movie .
negative
Whether this is art imitating life or life imitating art , it 's an unhappy situation all around .
negative
An uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection .
negative
A formula family tearjerker told with a heavy Irish brogue ... accentuating , rather than muting , the plot 's saccharine thrust .
positive
This is Sandler running on empty , repeating what he 's already done way too often .
negative
This is as lax and limp a comedy as I 've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material .
negative
Time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool `` Clockstoppers , '' but that does n't mean it still wo n't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life .
negative
The sort of picture in which , whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do , they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset .
negative
Has none of the crackle of `` Fatal Attraction '' , `` 9 1/2 Weeks '' , or even `` Indecent Proposal '' , and feels more like Lyne 's stolid remake of `` Lolita '' .
negative
A rehash of every gangster movie from the past decade .
negative
Gaping plot holes sink this ` sub ' - standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth .
negative
Talkiness is n't necessarily bad , but the dialogue frequently misses the mark .
negative
The beautiful images and solemn words can not disguise the slack complacency of ( Godard 's ) vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice .
negative
The stunt work is top-notch ; the dialogue and drama often food-spittingly funny .
positive
The movie is n't painfully bad , something to be ` fully experienced ' ; it 's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten .
negative
Charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past Love Story derisions .
negative
What a great shame that such a talented director as Chen Kaige has chosen to make his English-language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted .
negative
No amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story .
negative
The film ... presents classic moral-condundrum drama : What would you have done to survive ?
positive
The problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of Auschwitz II-Birkenau .
negative
... for all its social and political potential , State Property does n't end up being very inspiring or insightful .
negative
A film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this is n't .
negative
Little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point ... is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable .
negative
The nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations .
negative
This is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy .
negative
overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue
negative
The Master of Disguise falls under the category of ` should have been a sketch on Saturday Night Live . '
negative
Koepp 's screenplay is n't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own .
negative
Is it really an advantage to invest such subtlety and warmth in an animatronic bear when the humans are acting like puppets ?
negative
More successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex , dramatically satisfying heroine
negative
Clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades .
negative
It 's hard to pity the ` plain ' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss .
negative
Rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash .
negative
A banal , virulently unpleasant excuse for a romantic comedy .
negative
The drama discloses almost nothing .
negative
A minor-league soccer remake of The Longest Yard .
negative
Belongs in the too-hot-for-TV direct-to-video/DVD category , and this is why I have given it a one-star rating .
negative
As earnest as a community-college advertisement , American Chai is enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school .
negative
A dim-witted and lazy spin-off of the Animal Planet documentary series , Crocodile Hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring .
negative
Even fans of Ismail Merchant 's work , I suspect , would have a hard time sitting through this one .
negative
The world needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like Martin Scorsese .
positive
Sade achieves the near-impossible : It turns the Marquis de Sade into a dullard .
negative
( Lin Chung 's ) voice is rather unexceptional , even irritating ( at least to this Western ear ) , making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters .
negative
One of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies I 've ever seen .
negative
Though there 's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film 's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish .
negative
Unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making .
negative
Unless there are zoning ordinances to protect your community from the dullest science fiction , Impostor is opening today at a theater near you .
negative
It should be doing a lot of things , but does n't .
negative
Chen films the resolutely downbeat Smokers Only with every indulgent , indie trick in the book .
negative
... a rather bland affair .
negative
Soulless and -- even more damning -- virtually joyless , XXX achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence .
negative
A boring masquerade ball where normally good actors , even Kingsley , are made to look bad .
negative
All the Queen 's Men is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels , it should pay reparations to viewers .
negative
The filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart .
negative
Rather than real figures , Elling and Kjell Bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the naïf 's encounter with the world .
negative
Mariah Carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in Glitter here in Wisegirls .
positive
It 's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it 's all about the silences and if you 're into that , have at it .
negative
I suspect that you 'll be as bored watching Morvern Callar as the characters are in it .
negative
If you go , pack your knitting needles .
negative
The lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma .
negative
We do n't even like their characters .
negative
Some writer dude , I think his name was , uh , Michael Zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something , but , dude , the only thing that I ever saw that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck .
negative
The movie does n't generate a lot of energy .
negative
It is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously .
negative
This feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head
negative
Spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen , not screaming but yawning .
negative
It feels like very light Errol Morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs .
negative
A period story about a Catholic boy who tries to help a Jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell .
negative
The premise itself is just SOOOOO tired .
negative
Pair that with really poor comedic writing ... and you 've got a huge mess .
negative
Proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness .
negative
Did we really need a remake of `` Charade ? ''
negative
Stealing Harvard ca n't even do that much .
negative
Each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth .
negative
The only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game .
negative
You try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored .
negative
I spied with my little eye ... a mediocre collection of cookie-cutter action scenes and occasionally inspired dialogue bits
negative
Entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of watching Disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel .
negative
The satire is just too easy to be genuinely satisfying .
negative
Less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is .
negative
- style cross-country adventure ... it has sporadic bursts of liveliness , some so-so slapstick and a few ear-pleasing songs on its soundtrack .
positive
A feeble Tootsie knockoff .
negative
An awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers .
negative
... the story is far-flung , illogical , and plain stupid .
negative
The very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary .
negative
An allegory concerning the chronically mixed signals African American professionals get about overachieving could be intriguing , but the supernatural trappings only obscure the message .
negative
One key problem with these ardently Christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out .
negative
A relentless , bombastic and ultimately empty World War II action flick .
negative
( Hell is ) looking down at your watch and realizing Serving Sara is n't even halfway through .
negative
Too long , and larded with exposition , this somber cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community .
negative
Leaves viewers out in the cold and undermines some phenomenal performances .
negative
Swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress Andie MacDowell .
negative
The histrionic muse still eludes Madonna and , playing a charmless witch , she is merely a charmless witch .
negative
You have no affinity for most of the characters .
negative
Nothing about them is attractive .
negative
What they see in each other also is difficult to fathom .
negative
Diaz , Applegate , Blair and Posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert , if not amused .
positive
An inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more .
negative
It 's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition .
negative
Eight Legged Freaks falls flat as a spoof .
negative
No matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus , accepting a 50-year-old in the role is creepy in a Michael Jackson sort of way .
negative
You 'll just have your head in your hands wondering why Lee 's character did n't just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery .
negative
` Dragonfly ' dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo , manipulative sentimentality , and sappy dialogue .
negative
Movies like High Crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation .
negative
How about surprising us by trying something new ?
negative
Final verdict : You 've seen it all before .
negative
Throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , Windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old World War II movie for overly familiar material .
negative
Further sad evidence that Tom Tykwer , director of the resonant and sense-spinning Run Lola Run , has turned out to be a one-trick pony -- a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap .
negative
You 'll trudge out of the theater feeling as though you rode the Zipper after eating a corn dog and an extra-large cotton candy .
negative
A full-frontal attack on audience patience .
negative
It 's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled .
negative
Debut effort by `` Project Greenlight '' winner is sappy and amateurish .
negative
Too bad none of it is funny .
negative
The film , like Jimmy 's routines , could use a few good laughs .
negative
Purports to be a Hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging .
negative
Oh , and more entertaining , too .
positive
... in the pile of useless actioners from MTV schmucks who do n't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes .
negative
Humor in I Spy is so anemic .
negative
The film is strictly routine .
negative
In addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , Ballistic : Ecks Vs. Sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase .
negative
You can not guess why the cast and crew did n't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed .
negative
Barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull .
negative
We get the comedy we settle for .
negative
The uneven movie does have its charms and its funny moments but not quite enough of them .
negative
A word of advice to the makers of The Singles Ward : Celebrity cameos do not automatically equal laughs .
negative
And neither do cliches , no matter how ` inside ' they are .

The campy results make Mel Brooks ' Borscht Belt schtick look sophisticated .

negative
Cherish would 've worked a lot better had it been a short film .
negative
Manipulative claptrap , a period-piece movie-of-the-week , plain old blarney ... take your pick .
negative
All three descriptions suit Evelyn , a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new .
negative
Still , the updated Dickensian sensibility of writer Craig Bartlett 's story is appealing .
positive
True to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at .
negative
Does n't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the Sundance Film Festival two years ago .
negative
The plot is paper-thin and the characters are n't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours .
negative
Kaufman 's script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious .
negative
Queen of the Damned is too long with too little going on .
negative
It collapses when Mr. Taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller 's rush .
negative
Any film that does n't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss .
negative
... Blade II is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves .
negative
The Rules of Attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing .
negative
Though there are many tense scenes in Trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful .
negative
Feels strangely hollow at its emotional core .
negative
The high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : There 's very little hustling on view .
negative
This director 's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera .
negative
Characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle .
negative
That 's muy loco , but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of `` Dragonfly . ''
negative
It 's a movie that ends with Truckzilla , for cryin ' out loud .
negative
If that does n't clue you in that something 's horribly wrong , nothing will .
negative
Director Tom Shadyac and star Kevin Costner glumly mishandle the story 's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself .
negative
It 's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 .
negative
Like the Tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on
negative
As pedestrian as they come .
negative
A film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen .
negative
It 's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer 's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary .
negative
More intellectually scary than dramatically involving .
negative
An inconsequential , barely there bit of piffle .
negative
The abiding impression , despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz , is of overwhelming waste -- the acres of haute couture ca n't quite conceal that there 's nothing resembling a spine here .
negative
As saccharine as it is disposable .
negative
You come away thinking not only that Kate is n't very bright , but that she has n't been worth caring about and that maybe she , Janine and Molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another .
negative
The metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery .
negative
Very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all .
negative
Too much power , not enough puff .
negative
The attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show .
negative
It 's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by Taylor 's cartoonish performance and the film 's ill-considered notion that Hitler 's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances .
negative
A cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic Ladies and Gentlemen , The Fabulous Stains ... Crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential .
negative
For this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull Sorvino has no light touch , and Rodan is out of his league .
negative
Narc is all menace and atmosphere .
negative
Despite Juliet Stevenon 's attempt to bring cohesion to Pamela 's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs .
negative
It 's tough to be startled when you 're almost dozing .
negative
his ( Nelson 's ) screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it .
negative
It 's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead .
negative
A terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving .
negative
There are many definitions of ` time waster ' but this movie must surely be one of them .
negative
As it stands , Crocodile Hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 Godzilla , which combined scenes of a Japanese monster flick with canned shots of Raymond Burr commenting on the monster 's path of destruction .
negative
Enigma is well-made , but it 's just too dry and too placid .
negative
`` Sweet Home Alabama '' is what it is -- a nice , harmless date film ...
positive
One of the best , most understated performances of ( Jack Nicholson 's ) career .
positive
The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys ' take on adolescence feels painfully true .
positive
It 's a masterpiece .

They crush each other under cars , throw each other out windows , electrocute and dismember their victims in full consciousness .
negative
And we do n't avert our eyes for a moment .
positive
Third time 's the charm ... yeah , baby !
positive
By the end of the movie , you 're definitely convinced that these women are spectacular .
positive
Birot creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , 15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters .

Catch it ... if you can !
positive
American and European cinema has amassed a vast Holocaust literature , but it is impossible to think of any film more challenging or depressing than The Grey Zone .
negative
` Possession , ' based on the book by A.S. Byatt , demands that LaBute deal with the subject of love head-on ; trading in his cynicism for reverence and a little wit
positive
It 's the kind of movie that , aside from Robert Altman , Spike Lee , the Coen Brothers and a few others , our moviemakers do n't make often enough .
positive
Alternates between deadpan comedy and heartbreaking loneliness and is n't afraid to provoke introspection in both its characters and its audience .
positive
The script is smart , not cloying .
positive
Visually , ` Santa Clause 2 ' is wondrously creative .
positive
A bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception , which , while it may not rival the filmmaker 's period pieces , is still very much worth seeing .
positive
One fantastic ( and educational ) documentary .
positive
An ambitious ` what if ? '
positive
that works .
positive
`` The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys '' has flaws , but it also has humor and heart and very talented young actors
positive
Nice piece of work .
positive
` Stock up on silver bullets for director Neil Marshall 's intense freight train of a film . '
positive
It 's funny , as the old saying goes , because it 's true .

Though the film is static , its writer-director 's heart is in the right place , his plea for democracy and civic action laudable .
positive
From blushing to gushing -- Imamura squirts the screen in ` Warm Water Under a Red Bridge '
positive
Apart from anything else , this is one of the best-sustained ideas I have ever seen on the screen .
positive
Not a schlocky creature feature but something far more stylish and cerebral -- and , hence , more chillingly effective .
positive
Stupid , infantile , redundant , sloppy , over-the-top , and amateurish .

Go back to sleep .

I did n't laugh .

The worst film of the year .

In the book-on-tape market , the film of `` The Kid Stays in the Picture '' would be an abridged edition

A sour attempt at making a Farrelly Brothers-style , down-and-dirty laugher for the female set .

Eisenstein lacks considerable brio for a film about one of cinema 's directorial giants .
negative
Taken as a whole , The Tuxedo does n't add up to a whole lot .
negative
This is no `` Waterboy ! ''
negative
Something has been lost in the translation ... another routine Hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise .
negative
The result is an ` action film ' mired in stasis .
negative
... a movie that , quite simply , should n't have been made .
negative
By turns pretentious , fascinating , ludicrous , provocative and vainglorious .
positive
I ca n't recommend it .
negative
But it 's surprisingly harmless .
positive
What 's next ?
positive
The script is a dim-witted pairing of teen-speak and animal gibberish .
negative
Absolutely not .
negative
It sucked .
negative
A prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell .
negative
This is n't a movie ; it 's a symptom .
negative
What we have is a character faced with the possibility that her life is meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance , in a movie that is definitely meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance .

Does n't add up to much .
negative
One of the worst movies of the year .

A complete waste of time .

Long before it 's over , you 'll be thinking of 51 ways to leave this loser .
