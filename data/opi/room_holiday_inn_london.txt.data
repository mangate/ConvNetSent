We arrived at 23,30 hours and they could not recommend a restaurant so we decided to go to Tesco, with very limited choices but when you are hingry you do not careNext day they rang the bell at 8,00 hours to clean the room, not being very nice being waken up so earlyEvery day they gave us a candy bar and two bottlets of water whic is a very nice touch .
 We had a room with two double beds which was surprisingly roomy, considering the small hotel rooms I have in previous trips to London .
The room was quiet, clean, the bed and pillows were comfortable, and the service was adequate .
 We arrived about 11 am, room was ready .
 Room was good size for Europe ,  clean throughout .
 The Concierge desk called our room to ask if we needed any information or assistance .
 Room was plenty big enough and clean and tidy, bed was comfordable .
First, we walked in and the restroom door was broken .
 Our room was typical holiday inn the bathroom could have done with updating but was spotless .
 Our rooms were not ready, we were promised rooms at a later time, etc .
 My room   was positively huge by European standards .
 The bed was perfectly comfortable, I had ample desk space for my work and my bathroom was much bigger than I expected .
 My friends were given a two bed room which was considerably smaller but, like mine, was clean and stocked with the necessities .
 Early check, in only allowed  smoking  room, but it was entirely acceptable, and only the hallway had faint smke odor .
Rooms in the hotel are very small, as is the double bed .
 The room was tired with peeling wallpaper although it was renovated recently .
 It is common across Europe to have small rooms and this was small for a double .
 The public areas are fine if bland, the rooms comfortable if slightly cramped, the location good for tube and bus but just a little 'distant' .
 The rooms have an electric tea kettle and the tea and cream is provided .
 The room was clean but tired as were the public areas that we saw .
 The bedroom, although recently upgraded with a new bed   had wall paper that was unstuck at the seams throughout the room and the rest of the furniture appeared the quality of a budget hotel brand ,  the TV was an outdated model .
 The room was quiet apart from the hum of the minibar .
 The room was packed to capacity with queues at the food buffets .
 The over zealous   staff cleared our unfinished drinks while we were collecting cooked food and movement around the room with plates was difficult in the crowded circumstances .
 Room was comfortable, very well lighted, and well maintained by housekeeping staff .
 Only negative was that the room, fitted with twin beds, was small even for just two adults .
 The hotel was clean and the room was a decent size .
Paid for an executive room and it was not big enough for a family of 3 .
 There was no room once sofa bed was down as we had to climb over it to get to toilet once our daughter was in bed .
 Room and bathroom was very clean .
 After many phone calls and visits to the front desk regarding not being able to connect with the internet I was finally told it was not working in our room and they knew that it wasn't when we checked in .
 But I really liked the hotel ,  the rooms were decently sized, there was a nice bank of lifts in the lobby, and again, the staff was friendly, which goes a long way when you've just got off a ten hour flight .
 Our room was spacious by London standards and had all the amenities we needed .
 Also, one of my colleagues wanted to leave his room key for his wife but the front desk staff wouldn't allow him to do so .
 Our room was smaller than expected .
 I have experience with the small size of some European hotels, but this hotel room was the smallest I have encountered .
 The price we paid for our rooms was reasonable .
The double room is small as in most of London and only one person can walk by the bed at a time .
 There were a few marks and rips on wallpaper etc but overall room was in good shape and both room and bath were clean .
 The rooms were small but adequate and the empty fridge was a great ammenity .
 The room was spotless with a nice selection of toiletries in the bathroom which were re, stocked each day, also the bottle of water, fresh orange and kit kat chunky left each day was a nice touch too .
Bedrooms were fine for what was needed   and when a feather pillow was requested I was greeted with a friendly confirmation it was on its way .
 Rooms were well insulated from outside noise .
 firm, comfortable beds  windows that open  adequate mirrors  clothes drying line across bathtub  sinks and showers drained properly  stopper in sink sealed, which was good because we did our own laundry  night shades overlapped the window and each other enough to keep light out  mini, bar refrigerator ran quietly  free newspapers daily in elevator waiting areas  in, room safe  American sized wash cloths  all lights worked  enough electrical outlets  enough hangers  central air conditioning which worked and ran quietly  adequate elevators  no toilet problems  shower curtains sealed water from leaking onto the floor  anti, slip surface on bathtub shower  exhaust system in bathroom removed condensation from shower  always enough hot water in shower .
 Our room rate included two full breakfasts, free bottled water and Kitkat candy bars each day and was very competitive with the rates at other hotels we considered .
 Not sure what the regular rate is for a room, but I personally would not pay more than $100 for this hotel .
 In, room internet is outrageously expensive at 15 pounds   per day .
The room was clean,tidy a good size and extremly quiet .
 I made the reservation 2 moths ago requesting for 2 connecting rooms and was told could not guarantee connecting rooms until later .
 She called housekeeping, and the room was ready in 10 minutes !
 The room was a perfect size, spotlessly clean, and well equipped   .
after returning from our dinner the staff had left a bottle of wine in the room and a card wishing us a happy anniversary, such a lovely touch !
 They currently appear to be renovating the rooms once this is one I am sure it will be even better !
Had requested a double room, not available at time of booking and no notes in the reservation about this but we could have had a double if we had wanted to wait .
The room was about what we expected from a Holiday Inn although we could have used a bottle or can opener given that there was no mini bar .
 We stayed at the beginning and end of our trip, and both times our double room was clean, comfortable, and a good size .
 First was about a short que  , then about that he needed to go to the back room to check out if he could give me a double room instead of single and the thirth time that the printer was slow .
The room was ok, but wallpaper were detahced on few places .
 We were very pleased with our room which also had aircon as it was very hot in London at that time .
 We had two rooms with an interconnecting door which was a perfect arrangement and the accessible room had plenty of room for the wheelchair with a big bathroom   .
My room was good size for European standards, and had recently been overhauled and included hair dryer, fridge, and air conditioning .
 Getting to the rooms was slowed by construction crews working on other floors and a horrible elevator which requires your room key to operate .
 The lobby was big but the room was very small, I won't stay there any more .
 If you upgraded to the next level room, the fridge was stocked .
 Had it not been for the hotel confirmation that I made a copy of they did not want to give us a room even though it was already paid for months in advance .
 My room was very clean, bed was comfy and always made by the time I arrived back each day .
Room size is fine as of European standard, it's clean and tidy .
ROOM and SERVICE ,  our room was obviously not one of the renovated ones .
 Even though I requested a true king or queen bed, our room was a 2 twin that was hastily assembled into a king which meant that one of us was always falling into the gap between the beds .
 The beds were not very comfortable and the door to the bathroom was a sliding door that did not lock .
,  Decor in room was a bit dated .
,  Room was smaller than I thought it was going to be .
 A C either ineffective or not turned on but was just Spring, so room was comfortable cool with window opened for fresh air .
 The room was very reasonably priced, but very small .
 The beds were comfortable, but the bathroom was tiny as well .
The hotel is huge and our room was on the large side for London .
 It was a good quality room although the bed was and pillows were very firm .
 They changed our room for the rest of our stay but the room was not as nice and had a smaller folding bed   .
 What we got was a room where the hotel wall was on the left side and a roof under our window with full of cabbage .
Room wasn't that big but looks like brand new, bed was very comfy   .
 Bathroom also was very clean with no smell of chemistry .
 They also have a great room service menu and was surprised at the big portions and quality of the food, great to get a bit in your room after a night on the town .
The room was tiny, and the heater didn't work properly, The staff if great .
 It is a great location, the rooms are a bit basic, but clean and we actually got a pretty good view this time .
 Let's face it, just because the hotel is 4 star does NOT mean your room will be, but this really isn't too bad .
 The room also had a fridge which is great to store orange juice and anything else you might need, but the fridge really could have used a good scrubbing !
 On the plus side, the staff in the breakfast room was wonderful and friendly, as was the fine waitress the one night we had dessert at the ground, floor restaurant .
 We  upgraded  our room from a standard to an excutive room for and extra 175 pounds   and got a room that was maybe 150 sq ft, the bathroom was tiny and had a pocket door that was heavy and hard to close, the whole room needed to be updated .
 When we tried to use a phone card from our room it would not work so I asked the front dest to help me and was told they couldn't really !
 Our room was small and the wooden furniture was badly chipped and marked .
 I was 'upgraded' to a room that wasn't stunning or large ,  hate to think what regular room is like .
 Not too easy to find rooms for more than two people in London unless you compromise on a few things, such as cost, location etc .
We had an executive room and was disappointed to find that the extra bed was not done up and we had to call housekeeping to fold down the metal bed .
 The room   was very nice with a king size bed and a full size double sofa bed which was very comfortable and easy to use .
 I ordered room service one night, and the food was delightful, and the service was fast and friendly .
 I really cannot comment on the rate because we had a package deal for the entire trip, and I don't have a clue what our room rate was .
 Our room was small but tasteful .
 I do wish they had double rooms with double beds, but I was so exhausted when I went to be, I don't believe I even turned over, so I managed with the twin bed just fine .
 The rooms are quite small but everything we needed was there .
 The refrigerator did not work, and when we asked about it were informed that a refrigerator did not come with our room, even though it was in the room .
 After realizing that the room was 'Smoking  we went downstairs to change rooms and they told us the entire hotel was booked .
 The hotel room was very clean and the cleaning staff and breakfast staff were very attentive .
 Check, in was simple, and we made our way to the room in an elevator lift that whisked us up to the 20th floor in a matter of seconds .
 The room was clean, organized, and provided a great view of London .
 The breakfast room is  cattle market  like with queues for tables and at the servery, and we were led to tables that werent free more than onceThe decor is also fairly dated, with a 1970s feel to some of the public areas ,  the lounge bar has the ability to be good but is often used as a waiting area by people, occupying tables without having a drink, and doesnt work as some bars in lobby areas do at other hotels ,  the main bar is like a pub, and doesnt feel like part of the hotel .
 We requested a room on a high floor before we left and this wish was granted with a 15th floor room with a view for miles it was great !
 The room size was as expected, bigger then hotels in south beach, yet smaller then some resorts in the caribbean ,  however that being said, the room size is more than enough and we had several pieces of luggage in the room .
Standard rooms in this hotel fall far short of usual London four, star standard ,  they are small, have no safe, pants press or other amenities usually provided .
 The room was nice size with a small but adequate bathroom .
 The room was clean, the bathroom large enough, and I had a choice of pillows .
 If I had paid more than $100 for my room, I would have been disappointed .
 My husband and I stayed in one of their suites a few years ago over Christmas and the only complaint I had about it was that the sofa in the living room of the suite was as hard as a rock .
 check, in was quick, staff was helpful and rooms were clean  just to be very picky on details, restroom looked like it might have needed some refurbishment sometimes in the near future and also there wasn't actually much spare space in the room, but I assume it wouldn't have been much better in other hotels in London .
 Talking about food, something worth noticing is that there was a fridge in the room, but it was completely reserved for the mini, bar service beverages, which completely filled it .
We were able to find an internet deal and got a double room for about 100€ night   and I'd definitely suggest you to immediately book this hotel if you're lucky to find some similar offer .
 Check in was very easy, we we happy to learn that our room was ready at 11am and they up graded our room .
 If this is your first time to the UK and you travel a lot in the US, the room size is small .
   The room is very clean and modern, everyday it was cleaned and fresh towels were given even when we didnt put them on the floor .
 The lobby was absolutely heaving when I arrived, mostly tourists but some airline crew too, The room was small, and the tv was too .
 The bathroom was also tiny, and the water pressure abysmally low .
 Bed was comfortable, but the room was very hot, even with the window open .
30 to find our room was ready and the receptionist very helpful and friendly and my special requests had been noted and acted on .
 The room itself was clean but very dated think early '90s blue and yellow with pine !
 But, the room was bright and airy and a decent size .
 When I tried to check in early the receptionist persuaded me to purchase an 'upgrade' to an executive room as that was available but the regular room that I booked wasn't .
 Tiny room, dated furniture, the dirt from my shoes wasn't removed by the cleaners during my stay .
 The room was a little smaller than typical US hotels but very comfortable .
 Staff were very pleasant , especially the breakfast staff  Rooms were not particularly spacious but were clean and adequate, bathroom was modern but shower was not very powerful .
 When I finally got my turn she said four words to me,  name   sorry  I spelt out my name  credit card  I did think for a moment that she might say  Pin  or tell me my room number but obviously i wasnt worth the effort .
The room was a bog standard room, poorly lit with no light on the desk or indeed within 6 feet of it, a noisy aircon heater and a tv that you cant see from the sofa, you have to sit on the bed .
Room service is expensive but good, the food was delivered hot and was tasty but was chosen from the current uninspired Holiday Inn room service menu, when I ordered a £6 .
, but after I called room service it was promptly fixed .
The room was spacious and clean and the bed comfotable with the option to choose from 5 or 6 different kind of pillows depending on your needs or allergies etc .
 The website offers a standard room for less money, but we were told by the hotel that the only way to be guaranteed a non, smoking room was to upgrade to a King, so we paid extra .
Let me just say that the bed was king size, but the room was tiny and the bed took up most of it .
 It was clean, but the room was rather tired looking and needed to be updated badly .
 People are saying the rooms are small but one I was in was very much the Holiday inn standard size room and was in good condition .
 View was excellent from the room although weather was terrible during my stay .
 The rooms are very small and can feel kind of cramped when changing and stuff is on the bed .
 It was 15 pounds a day for in, room wired access or otherwise you had to buy a BT OpenZone card for 6 pounds for 1 .
Our room ,  and the hotel generally ,  was dated, looking a bit tired .
we ask for the room 10 minutes before check, in time and the room wasn't ready .
 We had a renovated room and it was really lovely and clean .
Now my room was clean, comfortable and the equipment all worked as it should but if this was an executive room then I would hate to have stayed in a standard room .
 Our rooms weren't ready when we arrived  , which was fine  but they also weren't ready for hours after the official check, in time .
 We also requested a room change, but for some reason this never worked out, but then again, we weren't in the room for much time as we were out sight, seeing .
 Mind you, hotel rooms in Europe are smaller than in the States, but this room was MORE than enough room for the two of us !
 Room was an Executive Club floor room and was larger than average for a London Holiday Inn, well laid out and everything worked !
Our room was on the 12th floor .
 I had pre booked my room through the priority club, I'm a platinum member and on checking in the reception told me their was only a twin room left .
 The room was that bad, I did not even unpack .
 Complaining again to reception got me a double room, which they said at check in was not available .
 The room was basic but cold, the heating system did not work at all .
Our room   was very comfortable, cosy and most importantly very clean .
 Rooms were cleaned every day without fail and toiletries and coffee sachets etc replenished .
 Rooms are clean and good size by English standards .
 The room size is actually not bad ,  in fact, it is larger than the room I stayed at the Holiday Inn Regents Park 6 months ago .
The major downside of my room is it faces Cromwell Road and also an exposed section of the Underground   .
The room has a small fridge, which is a bit cold, but is in desparate need of defrosting .
 However, no in, room safe which is a bit disappointing .
Bathroom is a bit small but acceptable .
 However, I'd be sure to request a room AWAY from Cromwell Rd due to the noise issue .
Room ,  clean, good size, everything you need is in the room including the coolerLocation ,  within every attractions, short walk or you can take the double decker just across the street .
 the bathroom door is a slide, door as there is no room for a normal hinged door .
 That said, most London rooms are small and as we were only sleeping there, it was not really a problem .
 There are no ironing facilities in standard rooms but there is an ill, publicised ironing room on floor 26 ,  you'll need to ask for directions .
 OK, the rooms are a bit on the small side, and it's a tad noisy generally of an evening, but what do you expect from a large hotel slap bang in the middle of one of the main arterial routes into London ?
From the time we booked Holiday Inn Forum Kensington I was overcharged some 200 GBP on the fee I was quoted and had some considerable trouble getting this rectified by Holiday Inns central booking officeWhen arriving at hotel in room safe   bar fridge as quoted were not supplied   when I questioned reception they said can't supply a safe but will send fridge up which they did, but for all the good it was with fixed thermostat the drinks we put in it would have stayed cooler outside the fridge .
 Bathroom looked new   was clean .
Nice clean rooms, good value, and average location near a tube station, but the rooms directing towards the main street outside are all VERY noisy .
 The room was immaculate, and perfect .
Booked this room via Lastminute's Secret hotels and is described as an awesome Kensington hotel .
Our first room was adequate, simple and clean .
The room was clean,comfortable and quiet .
 No problem said the receptionist I will fast track your room so it will be available at that time, and here is the key holder with the number of your room for when you return .
15, after a lot of searching on the computer and a long wait, we were informed our family room was not ready would we take a seat and we would be called when it was available .
 30 minutes later we were allocated a room,which was very small for three people, we then discoverd that the bed for my grandson had not been made up, nor was there any extra bedding in the room .
 There was insufficient room for suitcases, the decor was somewhat tired and the room was not soundproof .
 We only had breakfasts in the hotel and were not impressed for it to be served in a room that was not really a restaurant .
 no standard room was available 40 minutes before announced check, in right in time 30 minutes after   .
The room itself was fine for our family of three when the pull out bed for my daughter was closed but a tight squeeze when open !
 Still, the room was comfortable enough  and clean, although some of the fixtures and fittings were slightly worn, e .
For our purposes, the hotel was perfectly adequate ,  the location was good and the room was clean and quiet .
 The rooms are quite small but the problem is they really could use some renovation .
 The rooms were extremely small however and with the couch turned into a bed it was impossible to get from the bed to the bathroom .
 Arrived, didn't get the room we paid for or booked ,  apparently they are allowed to do this and its in the small print !
2,  When I tried to check in 2 days later they simply gave me a single bed room where my reservation was a twin bed room when they corrected it   I went to my room it was a smoking room   I had to go back to change it they said there is no rooms available   I have to sleep the night   they will transfer me in the next day like it was my fault  !
 when i told them that my room is a smoking room   I specified in my reservation that its non, smoking the employee asked me  I wonder how could you specify that    there was other incidents as well .
 The bathroom was small, and water pressure was weak, but it was doable .
 We arrived at the hotel 2 hours before check in, and were delighted when we were offered a free upgrade to a kingsize room, although this was a smoking room, there wasn't too bad a smell, and we just opened the windows .
 The room was a decent size for a London hotel room .
 Overall I couldn't have been more satisfied and far from assigning me a humble room because I'd booked a discounted Hotwire rate, I was given a room upgrade !
 The next day, after coming back from sighseeing at around midnight, we went up to the room after seeing the queue of 8 persons waiting to see the receptionist and amazingly our keys worked and our bags were where we have left them .
 Upon arrival to the room itself, we discover that we have in fact been given a disabled, non smoking room .
 I politely explained about my shock at being given a completely different room than what was booked !
 The room itself was small, though clean and well appointed with a complimentary bottle of wine and water .
 Basic necessities like iron, tea kettle, multiple TV channels, safe deposit lockers, newspaper are always available in the room as standard equipment   and there are no surprises .
 The rooms   toilets are of a certain size and you can settle in quickly, to start discovering the city you’re visiting .
 Check, in was super, quick, the rooms was spot, on and breakfast was more than elaborate .
 Our room was clean, though small, the service was great, and we would stay here again in a heartbeat !
The room was very small   but clean, modern and comfortable .
The room itself was dated and the en, suite tiny, but it did have everything you needed for a comfortable stay .
 The hotel room was very clean and housekeeping made up my daughter's bed five minutes after phoning reception .
 The room also has a fridge, which is not really a fridge, but a “cooler”, as described by staff .
 The bathroom is a good size .
 When we got to the hotel the front desk clerk told us that the double room we booked is not available because their reservation centre had overbooked the hotel .
 She was quick to add, however, that she would be willing to give us a free upgrade to an executive room for 1 night, which would normally cost us GBP35, but for the inconvenience, she would waive this upgrade fee for the first night only .
 In other words, if the room is already hot, you will not be able to cool it down unless you ask that the AC be turned on, or unless you open a window   .
 The room was what we were expecting .
 Room was on 3rd floor but there was a private function in their function suite .
The room we booked was supposed to be an executive room .
 The room we were given was small, poorly funished   it had the smallest bathroom we have ever had in an hotel and the traffic noise went on from about 06 :
 My room was a typical London size i .
 My room was non, smoking and did not smell like smoke .
 My room was clean, although since I only stayed one night I cannot comment about ongoing housekeeping .
 Overall, I would describe the room as free of serious problems, but drab and in need of modernisation or livening up .
 My bathroom was, like the room, small .
 By European standards, our room was large .
 The room was clean and breakfast OK .
When i checked in, i asked to be shown several rooms and the staff was happy to do so .
 Although smokers tend to get relegated to the worst rooms  , i was happy with my 6th floor room .
 We were upgraded to an Executive Room, which was fantastic , ,  double bed, lots of room, couch for extra seating .
 The room also had an  American outlet  which was very useful .
 We were very pleased with the room, and the staff was all very nice and helpful, including the concierge service .
 However, if the room rates were the same and or I was using my Priority Club points I would choose the Holiday Inn Kensington across the street   .
The room was a nice size , very clean and more than adequate .
 Why some people moan about the size of their room is beyond me .
 Yes the rooms are small, but realistically, how much time do you spend in the room ?
 The room I was in was ok, but the shower was terrible .
 The rooms are not well shielded from noise and I had folks yapping away in the corridoor practically all night .
 TV is placed in the room such that, if you try watching for a while, it is guaranteed that you will get stiff neck .
 We booked direct on the hotel website and paid 75 pounds per room per night, which is extremely good for London and for the quality of the rooms .
 We had arrived early and were prepared to wait for our room however we were offered an upgrade to an executive room because our allocated room was not yet ready .
 The room was spacious and comfortable and came with a complementary bottle of wine, water and other refreshments .
The only downside to the room is that is was very hot .
 The room was clean and contemporary .
 The room was actually pretty large compared to other hotel rooms I have seen in London .
 As expected, the room was smaller than the usual American hotel, but clean   quiet with fairly new furnishings .
 The room's refrigerator allowed us to cover several breakfasts   snacks by shopping at the convenience grocery store that was also just a block away, so we skipped the hotel's breakfast .
Small rooms but mine was clean and a lovelycomfy bed .
I got a good deal on this stay ,  2 nights for 123 pounds room only, through the priority club  , as I was coming to stay to go to a concert celebrate my daughters 16th Birthday .
Reception, not too busy when I checked in, my room was ready .
The room was small, but there was a window that opened and good views over london although the windows could do with a good scrub !
 The room was clean, and looked fine .
 There is an empty fridge in the room, ours wasn't working properly, so check if yours is before going down to Waitrose Tesco for chilled items I didn't !
But the room is as I have previously mentioned rather small ,  see the photos, literally just enough room to walk between the bed and the dressing table desk, but so long as you are not intending to spend much time in there you will be OK .
 Broadbadn access in the rooms is fine, but can slow down at peak times of the evening, the cost is also excessive .
 I have to say that the room was a bit small but not uncomfortable .
00am the room was ready for us so we could take a nap to get over the jet lag and head out for an afternoon   evening of sight, seeing so we didn't lose any time due to the time difference .
 The room was clean, neat and very well kept .
 If you are a tourist who will only be in the room to sleep and shower this is the place for you .
Service was friendly, our room was on the highest floor  , but that wasn't a problem because of the lifts, and we had a great view of the city from the room .
 The room was average sized, but I'm not paying to swing a cat in a hotel room .
 Instead of an executive room with a king bed and a wonderful breakfast each day at the MG, this trip we paid more to stay at this Holiday Inn and definitely had fewer and less posh amenities .
 We knew the rooms were small, but ours wasn't too small .
Our room was always cleaned very well daily .
 the room is just the smallest darn thing you'll ever see .
 The room is generally spotless and the cleaning ladies do a great job of refilling all of the usual stuff .
 The bathroom was generally spotless throughout .
 however the corridors to our room had a pungent smell of deep heat, walls were covered in marks and the gerenal appearance of public areas is dusty and old fashioned .
 the room we booked was an executive .
 the bathroom was looking tired aswell .
 the second room was exactly the same .
 Room was still a small European style room .
The room was spotlessly clean and in good repair and also being a light sleeper i found it to be very quiet considering the hotel was so large .
All in all a great place to stay for a getaway break in london try and a room on a higher floor overlooking the city it is worth it !
 The room was as expected for a Holiday Inn, cute little fridge with lots of goodies, a teapot, comfortable beds, clean, neatly renovated bathroom, plenty of hot water, overall pleasant .
 Non, smoking room and floor was actually non, smoking !
 Usualy i still smell smoke from somewhere , even on the non, smoking rooms, not this time .
 Our room was very clean, although a bit small  .
 Staff very friendly and I always worry when booking through priceline that I will get the worst rooms because the price was so good but got a great room on the 16th floor facing the London Eye .
 Hotel was able to give us a two bed non, smoking room which is exactly what we wanted .
Stayed here for business , first room was very small but after they changed my room it was fine .
I also got a phone call in the room on the second day from a strange man asking if I had found an ear ring which was lost that day in my room .
 Bathroom was comparable to an average North American hotel, which means fairly big for Europe .
 My room was clean with tea and coffee making facilities, but there was wallpaper coming away from the walls and there was no cover on the bed, simply a duvet in a white sheet .
 I originally asked for a room above the 10th floor looking over London but that side of the hotel was fully booked so got and upgrade to an executive room .
 The room was still small with barely enough room between the bed and dressing table but it did have a sofa and complementary half bottle of wine, fruit juice, water, and chocolate bar at the hotels prices this would of cost of over £20 ,  Chocolate bar is £3 .
 I was booked into the same room as the one I complained about last time and the TV is still not fixed !
 Upon returning to the room after the false alarm, he was nowhere to be seen, so I connected the TV up and put the trolley outside the room .
An ok Hotel if you get a room at a discounted rate .
 The hotel itself is in need of an upgrade, its getting a bit tired, but saying that, the room was clean .
 The room was on the small side, but had a great view of North London   .
 The bathroom was ok, however there seemed to be a lack of water pressure, so the shower was a kin to standing under a tap .
 The bathroom is bright and clean, with a modern tub and good water pressure .
 As a priority club member I expected to have a decent room but this was not the case .
 The room was extremely small .
 Room was small but adequate as I basically used the room to sleep in .
I appreciate that we had a large room so it's difficult for me to comment on comfort of the standard room's, however, the mentality we have is we'd rather spend time exploring, so the size of the room isn't necessarily important .
 The rooms were all modern although for an Executive Room all you basically get extra is a bottle of water, orange juice and robe   .
 Our room was more than comfortable for two but when me made up the third bed the room was incredibly cramped ,  then again this is Central London  !
Another word of warning when booking through the Holiday Inn website ,  VAT was NOT included in the price at the time of booking until you actually processed the booking and paid for the room ,  this is apparently now normal for many London hotels which I'd never experienced before ,  we ended up paying £17 more per night than I'd expected .
 Yes, the standard rooms are small for two people   and, yes, they seem to have a lot of trainee staff at the front desk, who struggle sometimes with the language, and yes some of the rooms are affected by traffic noise, but for a good location and a no, frills room provider, it is hard to beat .
 it was very hard to move around the room when the sofa bed was pulled out   as another reviewer said you'd have to crawl to move around  .
 The rooms that overlook the railway lines can be a little noisy, otherwise I haven't been disturbed by external noise .
 The bathroom was modest in size and had a tub .
 The decor of the hotel and the rooms looks cheapand not worth the money I was paying .
 Our room was clean, spacious and smart .
 Two people couldn't walk within the room at the same time but I guess that is a problem with most hotels in Europe .
 About the hotel, the first room given to us was having stained and patchy carpet and the duvet was also stained .
 The second room's phone did not work, whicch was again changed immediately after reporting .
 The rooms have never disappointed and the food is always nice .
 We stayed at the Holiday Inn for about a week and the room was clean and quiet .
 Yes, the rooms are small but most hotel rooms are small in Europe so this was not a surprise .
 The bathroom is tiny but at least there is a bathroom attached to the room  in a lot of hotels that I looked at online in the same price range, bathrooms were not en suite .
 Despite its size, and the fact that there are over 20 floors of bedrooms, lift service was never slow, and the breakfast operation   is exceptionally well, managed .
 Check in was prompt, and the room clean and tidy, a bit small, but this is central London .
 The room is very small, which is fairly typical for London .
 The room was small but not overly so .

 Room wasn't luxurious but did exactly what we wanted in that it was clean and had a comfy bed !
 Room was clean and bathroom was compact and modern .
The room itself was very clean, the bathroom was small but immaculate .
 The luggage facility was superb too, we had no problems in checking out of the room and leaving our luggage which was securely labelled and organised, for no extra cost .
 We booked the room as a triple, and were pleasantly surprised to find three single beds, rather than a double and a sofa bed .
 The room was generally clean .
The bathroom was adequate, and was cleaned each day .
The room was OK, ish, Great view as any other building with 20
 Instead of Mini Bar my room had just the hole where it normally is placed and some hanging cables .

 Plus, the bathroom is a good size .
 The rooms are very clean and come with a mini fridge that is empty and can be filled upon request .
 The room was good and functional .
 People asked to be changed rooms all the time and this was not my first time staying in hotels .
 The service at the breakfast room was ok .
 Overall, we found the hotel only good for location and decent room if somewhat cold just like the weather was in London then .
 The room was very clean and was quite big for a London hotel room .
 The room was clean and , by London standards, decently sized .
Stayed in room 516 right at the end of the corridor was next to a services room from which there was a constant generator   fan noise .
 This noise could be heard inside the room and was irritating ,  the television had to be turned up to be heard and so on .
 Otherwise the room was fine for one, but was rather compact and would have been too cramped for two people .
 No other problems ,  the room was clean, the bed was comfortable and everything in the room worked .
The room was a typical Holiday Inn effort but I have to commend the cleanliness ,  nothing broken, damaged or grimey and the bathroom smelt fresh .
 Small, with soft beds the room served well for the night we stayed and the card controlled lift access was a nice feature which made the hotel feel more secure .
 Within the same complex is a Boots and Waitrose so filling the provided in, room fridge with snacks is a doddle .
00 to get a room, need to fill in a form, be careful when order newspapers, they charge you except priority club member, this is not mentioned anywhere on the form, and unacceptable considered it is normally included in many other four stars hotels, paid £140 per night and they asked for another 65 pence for newspapers, cheapskate !
 good size considered it is in london, comfy double bed, clean in room, tea coffee choc making facilities, hairdryer under desk, old tv, toilet facilities was disgusting, long curly black hair in bathtub, big black pubic hair tangled in hand towel, disgusting yellow scum stick on toilet seat, dove shampoo bottle near bathtub and dove cream cleanser bottle near hand basic were both empty, cheap plastic canteen cups on wash basin, only one tiny hand soap, NO supply of essential basic vanity kits   only available if ask, cheap standard chain hotel decor, room was quiet, did not hear anything from the street, but doors closed loudly from nearby rooms on the corridor .
 Once we had access to our room on the 14th floor, we were pleasantly surprised .
 The room was very clean and tidy although a little small .
 I would not pay rack rate for a room here, but it is quite attractive at a discounted price .
 Although my room was only on the fourth floor, the noise, proofing was quite impressive, and I could barely hear street noise from Cromwell Road .
 My room was small but it was clean and everything was okay except for the wireless internet which kept going in and out every 5 minutes .
 In all, as with many Holiday Inns hotels worldwide, affordable with good rooms and customer service but there is always one or two issues that keep this chain from being a affordable and good place to stay .
 Our westward facing room was on the 17th floor, and we saw a couple of beautiful sunsets out the windows, sharing wine and cheese that we’d purchased at the Waitrose supermarket a block away on Gloucester Rd or at the Sainsbury supermarket two blocks down Cromwell Rd .
 As others have mentioned, the room is small, a bit bigger than a room on a cruise ship, but it’s immaculate, has a small refrigerator, and has a well appointed bathroom with vanity and full tub and shower .
 As other reviewers have remarked, our room was small, and designed for only the purposes of bathing, watching TV, and sleeping .
 In the sliding, door bathroom, there was no hair dryer, common amenities like shower caps, shampoo, etc .
 The bathroom in our room was immaculately clean .
 About the only negative thing I can say about the room, was that when the sofa chair was pulled out into the single bed for the third adult, there was absolutely only about 4 inches between the end of the bed and the desk in order to pass to go to the bathroom .
00 US dollars per night and previously requested a room with 3 beds as we are 3 males who wanted our own beds and I was prepared to pay for the upgrade .
Although smaller rooms are expected in Europe, the room with 3 beds in this hotel is considerably smaller than most standard size US hotel rooms .
 It was not available in our room and was very expensive   to use in the lobby area .
 We did ask for a high room but that was ignored i think !
The room was small, but clean .
 Nothing to say that this room was a  priceline  room .
 The room was kept clean, and restocked with cups, teas, etc as they were used .
 Although we had email confirmation that the room was prepaid, the check in staff insisted that the “back office” didn’t actually take payment and wanted us to pay again .
 So on check out, not only did the staff try to take another payment, they tried to take it at normal room rates and not the discounted rate !
 our room, which was a handicap access room due to the crowded season, was actually a great choice, as the bath is large, light filled and with updated fixtures .
 both rooms were kept very clean during our extended visit .
 It proved good value for a regular room but the advertised extras to justify the  executive   tag were not all there .
Our room was neat and clean with no problems at all .
 Comfortable room with large bed but limited space as is often the case with London hotels, but I found the location excellent .
 The disappointment was that when we got to our room the extra bed was infact a sofa and it was not ready, which at that time of night was quite inconvenient .
 The room was perfectly comfortable with great views, although I wish I was on a higher floor .
 The bedroom was small   but the bathroom was good sized and exceptionally clean .
 There was quite obviously a large choice of rooms available and the female check in receptionist managed to find me a non, smoking twin room with a view of london no problem   all the way over to what I assume to be Hammersmith .
 8am on a sunday morning is a tad early to be ringing the room doorbell, though it is a large hotel and we had forgotten to put the 'do not disturb' sign out .
 that there didn't really seem to be a functioning air vent in our bathroom so it was a bit of a sauna after you used the shower, and 2 .

90 otherwise if you pay in The Forum room on the first floor until we'd been there a day or two  slightly patchy face cloth supply, the one time no, one in maintenance or reception would answer the phone, and the biggie ,  despite the warmest London autumn on record, the a c was switched off   and the room was always too hot .
 We were given a standard double room on the 27th floor which is the top floor .
The room itself was everything you would expect for a 4 star chain hotel .

 That's a good price even though the room was tiny, however, when it came to the continental breakfast, the hotel would not permit us to partake of same, telling us that because we reserved through Hotwire, we were ineligible for the breakfast .
 Because of the room size, the lack of continental breakfast for those who reserve outside of the Holiday Inn web site, and the distance to many attractions, we WILL NOT STAY in the hotel during our next trip to London .
 Other than that, our stay was uneventful and the room was clean, if a bit small .
 The room was not extravagant, but very comfortable .
 The hotel exterior is a bit plain, but the room was comfortable .

 Hotel rooms are expensive in London so if you want something convenient, cheapish and near to a Tube this is ideal but be wary of the fact that this is a massive hotel and there will be queues for breakfast, check in, etc .
 Take a look at the breakfast room to see just how big an issue size is .

 The room was also very roomy .
 The views from the higher rooms are just fantastic and the male desk person who checked me in was very nice and gave me a room on a high floor .
 These were minor issues, considering how great the room was .
Additionally, one other problem was that room service was very very inefficient ,  requesting a menu to be brought to the room took 45 minutes and the guy actually had the audacity to suggest he read it to me over the phone instead of sending one up, after I had to call three times .
 The unit in my room seemed to run endlessly and was quite noisy, particularly during the early morning hours .

 We got in about 9am to the Holiday Inn, and the room wasn't ready yet   .
The room was adequately sized ,  there are only two of us, so we weren't looking for much .

 There are individual temperature controls in the room, which was great .
We stayed 5 nights in a room whose price was second lowest .
 Room size is fine and bathroom is good .
 and got the room right away even though the check in time is at 2 p .
 Three of us stayed in the executive room, it was a little bit crowded though but not as horrible as previous post declared .
 I think it is a good idea that you have to use your room card to get the elevator moving, it is just a security issue .
 On arriving at the hotel, we were greeted by a very friendly valet who parked our car for us   and we were able to leave our luggage as we were early and the room was not ready .
 We made our way to the room and a real pain is the fact that every time you use the lift you have to put your key card in before the button will work .

face it, London is very expensive, and rooms are not up to US standards  This hotel is PERFECT for the American that wants a clean, comfortable, reliable room without spending a fortune .
 When we stepped into the room it was an even greater relief, on the 17th floor we had a wonderful view of Earl’s Court and some Georgian architecture, our favorite visual was an advertisement against smoking, in which there was a cigarette half un, wrapped with what appeared to be a fatty clogged artery inside .

 Room was small but perfectly kitted out ,  spotless with thoughtful facilities like retractable clothes line over the bath , mini, bar, hair, dryer etc .
 Breakfast was included in our room rate ,  and it was a great feast ,  lots of fresh fruit, interesting sausages, Japanese breakfast option ,  and the big dining room had a nice buzzy holiday feel to it .
 Our first room had an unbearable odor from an unflushed toilet which made me think,  Who else is using the room when guests are not using them .
  Of course we got a different room  , but why wasn't it cleaned before ?
 We found the hotel rooms to be very clean, especially the recently refurbished bathrooms .
 The room was fairly large by London standards, but storage space   was minimal .

 I had requested a room on a non smoking floor, but ended up having to take a room on a smoking floor that was on the end of a hall .

 We stayed in a triple room which was supposed to be the biggest they had .
 The room, although clean, was extremely small, for American standards .

 My wife adds the bathroom was very clean, with nice towels and hot water every day .
 The room is a tad small but is super clean and great location .
This is a 900 room hotel so can get busy at times in the lobby but the staff, standard of the rooms and other facilities are geared up to cater for this .
 The hotel itself is very clean and the rooms were comfortable, the staff are very friendly and helpful and the check in desk was always well staffed so it only took 2 minutes to check in and out .
 Got my room through Priceline   and was more than impressed .
 The rooms were consistent both times and on separate floors .
 The room was airconditioned and quiet  .
 The light in a bathroom would not turn on and we contacted the front desk and told them this .
 The room was very clean and efficiently laid out, although having to make due with the limited room in the refrigerator was kind of a bummer, we made the most of it !

 The room was very comfortable, clean, and rather roomy for European standards .
, We booked our room through an internet service and was lodged in an executive room that included all the aminities expected in a 5, star hotel !
 The hotel room was definitely as spacious and clean as all the hotels I've stayed in mainland Europe .
 I arrived at 1030am and my executive level room on the 5th floor was ready   .
 The bathroom was small, but the tub was deep   .
 This is a great hotel, nice rooms, not too big but this is not a problem .
 The bathroom was immaculate everytime we returned to the hotel and the water pressure in the shower is fabulous .
 The view from our 19th floor room was wonderful and included Big Ben and the London Eye  .
 We were not allowed into the room until 2pm ,  it seemed to be policy, regardless of whether or not our room was ready as all the other people in the check, in queue got the same message .
 Everything worked well, was in good condition and the room was quiet in spite of the hotel's busy location .
 However, the room   was extremely small .
 The room was thoroughly cleaned every day .
 When I arrived in my room with two small children the previous occupier had left unused medicine in the mini bar, this took until the following evening to get someone to remove this .
 Also when we booked the hotel we were told we would have a double bed and a single bed but at check in were told we had a fold down bed that when folded down stopped my daughter and myself from using the bathroom, the only way was to climb over the bed .
 The room was very comfortable although the cupboard space was very limited .
 Be cautious of using the room services like the phone, mini bar and room service as the prices are sky high, but I would definitely stay there again and I would recommend this hotel to anyone !
