 rooms somewhat small but clean and comfortable .
 Although we arrived after 3pm, rooms were not ready and we were asked to wait .
 We had 2 rooms, both were clean and ok, but strangely set up   and sparstly equiped not enough hangers, towels, etc .
We stayed here for 2 nights, the rooms are lovely, very clean, modern, and comfy !
 My room was supposedly upgraded to a larger room, but if this was the case I'd hate to see the smaller rooms .
 If all the rooms are as small I would not want to stay for a long time .
Good Location Small Rooms Some charm
 Free internet in the lobby but none of any sort in the rooms .

 The location is good and the rooms are very pretty and clean .
 We were five people with two rooms .
 We had street side rooms and all night long there were busses and loud noises so no one got good sleep .

I'm not sure why so many people say the rooms are small here, but our standard king size bed room was huge in my opinion .

 I agree with other travelers that the rooms are small, and the street noise is sometimes annoying .
The rooms we had were a good size and clean .
 I did have to search through the usual online websites to find the best deal for rooms, but if you take time to look, I think you will be happy with the rates you get .
 The Hotel   rooms are very clean and great food at their resturant .
pthe only negative thing's i will say is that the coffee maker in the room is a dreadfull waste of space and thee coffee pods and i stick of sugar and 2 pouches of milk a day is ridiculas there are no tea coffee making facilitys in the rooms to be honest as the coffee maker is just plain crazy .
 The rooms are decorated well, not too flashy and yet still modern .
 Yes, the rooms aren't that big, but after deciding that our main goal was to find a nice clean hotel close to Fisherman's wharf and near a lot of the public transportation, it was a perfect choice for us .
We arrived from LA having paid the rooms in advance but were immediately hit by a $40 day surcharge to park our car .
The rooms were a decent size for a city hotel and were very clean and well serviced .
Parking is expensive, Rooms are on the small side .
 The rooms are probably smaller than at a major chain, but you're not here to sit in your room .

 The rooms were large and comfortable and the location was fine if you don't mind a little walking to the Wharf and other attractions .
I don't know about the street view rooms but we had no problems with noise whatsoever .
The rooms were pleasant, clean and did not disappoint .
 Perhaps they like to let out all the 'close to lift ' rooms to be kind to housekeeping ?
Booked two rooms on Priceline for $139 each, just an overnight stay while flying home the next morning .
 Check in was good, rooms both ready, and we upgraded with no problems .
 older hotel with smaller rooms but updated nicely .
 It was pretty small, so I'm sure the standard rooms are even smaller !
 The rooms are very nice and seem recently upgraded .
 We have stayed at this hotel once before, a few years ago, so knew that the rooms were not particularly large .
 Some say the rooms are small, but ours wasn't that tiny .
 A normal size hotel room compared to other hotel rooms we have stayed in, besides we didn't spend much time in the room when there is so much to do around San Francisco .
 The rooms were small, very small .
 The staff at the hotel more than made up for the tiny rooms .
The only other negative and its a small one, was the size of the rooms,they are tiny but were cleaned well and were ready when we returned every day .
 The rooms were very nice, clean and comfortable .
 They said they noticed we had three people so had automatically provided a cot to our room, I was told they were full and there were no other rooms available .
 The rooms were a little bit tired and with the simple expedient of renewing the wallcovering would show a great improvement .
 The bed was comfortable and the rooms and bathrooms were kept clean and although the refrigerators are honour bars the hotel is happy for you to chill your own drinks in them .
The rooms were nice, comfortable, and clean .
 Our rooms faced the street rather than the courtyard and the traffic ,  especially the motorcycles ,  were loud all night long .
 I suggest you request a room facing the courtyard even numbered rooms, I think ?
Very comfortable beds and rooms ,  nice decor !

 Be sure to ask not to be put in the rooms right above the driveway entry .

 Rooms nice, beds very comfortable !
we found a friendly staff through out the hotel great location,rooms were small but as pointed out to me all land is prime in the area and all places have small rooms .

 But, we couldn't move again because there were no other rooms available with king .
 The beds very comfortable, rooms tastefully decorated and were very clean and comfortable .
 The rooms were nice but not spectaular .
The location  the rooms  the staff  the concierge  the Managers nightly wine reception    everything about this hotel made our holiday MAGIC .
 Currently   they are remodeling some rooms on the upper floors, and there is considerable construction noise in some areas that started after 9 :
 I am so dispapointed that I can't remember what room # it was becasue apparantly after reading other reviews, there are some newer and nicer rooms .
 The rooms are large comfortable and well furnished, suitable for business travelers or tourists .
The pics of the rooms are the same as they present them online .
 I thought the rooms were good .
 different rates for their rooms .
 The hotel was clean, quiet, large rooms and very close to the Wharf and local restaurants .
 Rooms were a bit small and appear to be older construction, rooms facing the road are a bit noisey at AM rush hour so we requested to be moved to the courtyard side which was a good move .
 The rooms were decent size, clean and had all of the basic amenities .
 I was surprised by the size of it, because we've stayed in other hotel rooms in large cities and the rooms were always tiny .
The travel agent booked this hotel and this was the only hotel out of 10 that I did not book myself although hotel sounded ok This was part of the deal for the airfares  Location is excellent , Rooms Ok Staff variable some very helpful others not so  .
 The rooms   that number 401, 402, 403, 405, 406, 408, 409, 412, 414, and 415 face out to the main street .
Stayed for two nights, there were six of us in three rooms .
Very cleanSmall rooms, but have a couch, chair, desk, etc .
, Get in inside room facing courtyard if you are light sleeper as outside rooms face the streets .
 The rooms seemed to have been recently renovated with updated decor .
The hotel is newly decorated and rooms are a nice size, extremely new and clean .
 The rooms and the double beds were very small, both quite a bit smaller than the Tenaya .
We had booked two connecting rooms since we were travelling with our boys, ages 11   15, and I called several days prior to arriving to remind them of our request .
 We took just one room for that night and they moved us to adjacent, though not connecting, rooms the next two nights .
 Beware, if you request adjoining rooms, they are not guaranteed and really not even planned .
 They told me they don't assign rooms until the day of check, in, and they were also overbooked .
Great location clean rooms we enjoyed our visit .
 The rooms are a bit small, but not uncomfortably so .
This hotel offers clean, well, kept rooms which are good value for money .
 The staff was very helpful and the rooms were well apportioned .
 The rooms are a bit small for more than three adults .
 Apparently the inner rooms have the wall units .
 The rooms were clean, nicely decorated, and comfortable .
 We made our reservations several months ahead of time and requested two adjacent double rooms as my husband and I were travelling with our two teenage daughters .
 They gave us two rooms on the same floor but on opposite sides of the hotel .
 We've gone many places and made this request and this hotel is the first one that did not put us within a couple rooms of each other .
 Nevertheless, I did like this hotel,  the rooms, location, and most of the service and I would stay here again .
Great place to stay ,  very clean and confortable rooms and helpful staff .
 I would recommend this hotel as a good base for a short break to San Fran ,  the hotel rooms weren't the biggest so a longer stay might not be as enjoyable
 I asked the desk clerk when we checked in if the rooms were as small as they said they were in the reviews .
 The hotel is pretty much as you'd expect from the chain , nice clean rooms well serviced, and the staff were extremely helpful,  very pleasant to deal with .
 In our opinion, a bit of faux Italian décor, some nice throw pillows on the bed and smaller than average rooms doesn’t really stretch to “European, style Boutique Hotel” .
 I asked the front desk whether we could move rooms .
 The woman was very helpful and said that as they had declared a number of rooms non, smoking she could offer me a room on the 2nd floor which would be much quieter as it faced a wall .
 Alarm bells rang in my head when she said they had made rooms non, smoking but I agreed to go and look .
 She told me that due to the high number of non, smoking rooms requested they had to make more rooms available .
 Also, avoid rooms on the ground floor facing Mason Street – not only will the street noise be terrible but there is a permanent smell of stale urine along that sidewalk .
 Boudin Bakery an excellent nearby option for breakfast lunch and with Trader Joes right next door you should not need to avail yourself of the very expensive mini bar in the rooms .
 The rooms were cozy, very tastefully done and included a fantastic bed .
The hotel was nicely decorated and so too were the rooms .
 Rooms are small but very quaint .
Upon arriving late through no fault of our own and finding our room double booked we were put up in a nearby sister hotel   until our room was ready the next day and they give us a complimentary bottle of champagne ,  after this though there were no more snags and everything went great ,  hotel staff friendly and helpful ,  rooms were quiet, clean and comfortable ,  food in the restaurant fabulous ,  the situation of the hotel was very convenient ,  just a few mins walk from fishermans wharf with a public transport stop, supermarket, small shops, bars and cafes also really close at hand ,  approx 10 mins walking distance for ferries to alcatraz and bay cruise, etc ,  would definitely stop here again
 Rooms good, decor very well done in Italian style Tuscan !
 Rooms very impressively decorated and clean .
the beds are great, several good pillows and the rooms are super .
 The furnishings are superb, rooms comfortable, and the icing on the cake was that every evening between 5 and 6pm they put on wine and beer tasting with nibbles for all the guests in the lounge !
 The rooms are just a tad bit small, , , but we didn't spend much time in our room .
 We were both delighted with the friendly staff, clean rooms and very convenient location .
 I loved the shampoo and soap in the rooms .
 The rooms' furniture and amenities were quite nice .
 Rooms are small but tastefully done, very clean and the staff friendly and helpful .

Downsides are disinterested staff, bordering on rude and quite small rooms .
 The rooms were gorgeous, decorated in black, white, red and some green here and there .
 I'm a travel agent so I'm pretty picky about my hotel rooms but I have to say I will be suggesting this hotel to my clients .
 The rooms are on the small side but if your not traveling with a big family or a lot of luggage, these rooms are just fine .
 Our rooms were of adequate size, very clean and as requested overlooking the courtyard area, which was very pretty .
 The rooms are spotless and the employees are as nice as you could ever want .
 Ask to see a few rooms before you check in, because the room size and location can vary between floors and sides .
BUT ,  the external facing rooms can be noisy from traffic, so make sure you request an internal room, facing the courtyard .
 The hotel has 4 levels with a variety of King, Double, King Suite and Double Suite rooms available .
 This was not what we wanted but there were no rooms with 2 regular beds and it was late at night .
 Great clean rooms with a fantastic shower !
 Rooms are a bit tight especially if you get the two doubles .
 Also, we got connecting rooms, but check first because there are only so many available .
The rooms are pretty standard size, were nice and clean, and comfortable .
Our family of five stayed in two rooms at the Tuscan Inn for two nights during the first week in January .
 It seems to be an older hotel, with the resulting small rooms, but is very attractive .
 Although the rooms were clean and fresh, one of ours had several small problems ,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the thermostat didn't work properly .
 The rooms are a bit small, but not unusual for San Francisco .
 It has everthing you need to have a great time in a great city,  location, good service, great food  , comfortable rooms and a complimentary happy hour .
 The rooms were quite small but well set out and our room looked into the courtyard .
 As previous reports suggest the rooms are a bit smaller than some other hotels we have stayed at but we were only there to sleep .
 The rooms, although a little on the cramped side, were tastefully furnished and immaculate .
 It represents value for money, the rooms and bathrooms were impeccably clean, fresh linen daily, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly .
 The rooms are equipped with minibars and air, con .
 We checked out the adjacent Holiday Inn Express ,  rooms of equivalent price and size but no mini, bar and, though air, conditioned, no persistent drone when in the &quot off&quot  position ,  though request a room at the front ,  a streetcar line runs at the back and those drivers love to ring the bell !
 We joked about the rooms being sound proof since we never heard other guests and we slept great .
 Apparently, all the rooms are similarly afflicted .
 Streets in the neighborhood carry a lot of traffic, and rooms on the streetside might be too noisy for your tastes .
 The rooms are small but very clean, charmingly decorated with a view of the little flowered courtyard, comfy beds, plenty of pillows   towels and smiling service .
 I really didn't get a chance to experience the staff's level of service but the rooms are small as is the bathroom .
 We stayed there with another couple in 2 rooms .
 I was totally amazed that the other guests didn't budge out of the way so we could get to our rooms .
 Our rooms were very small but beautifully decorated .
 Some rooms had the bathroom sink outside the bathroom, which we would have preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .
 While the rooms were lovely for that price they were extremely small, but the location was just perfect .
 The rooms were very nice, could of use just a little more shelf space by the bathroom sink .
 It is in a great location, the staff is always alert and courteous, the rooms are clean, the morning coffee and biscotti are a nice touch, the happy hour is a PLUS, and the price is right  !
 The rooms are comfortable, clean and nicely furnished .
 The rooms were very nice ,  it wasn't the usual beige hotel room which made a nice change .

 The rooms were also quiet and we felt safe .
 The rooms were celan and well kept .
Arrived before check in and was told that two courtyard rooms were reserved for my party and available at 3 :
40 and my rooms were not even ready .
 Upon entering our rooms, we see that our view was not of the courtyard, but of a brick wall .
 Their response was that there were no courtyard rooms available .
 Why they promise two rooms with a courtyard view, when they don't even have one to offer is beyond me .
I feared the room size because of the other reviews, but I think we got lucky and received one of their larger rooms .
The rooms were freshly and creatively decorated, and meticulously clean .
A wonderful stay, staff especially friendly, complimentary wine tasting a definite plus, rooms well appointed and well kept .
 Extremely comfortable rooms, with minibar, TV, alarm clock, ironing board and iron, moring newspaper .
 Our rooms were so much nicer then we expected and the staff was friendly and helpful .
 Contrary to the comments of a previous reviewer, I never saw the rooms advertised anywhere as having 2 queen beds !
 The rooms are extremely clean and have windows that actually open to the outside .
 We never heard a sound from other rooms besides the door next to ours opening and closing .
 One of the smallest rooms in any Best Western I have stayed in .
 We asked at front desk and then said they would send someone up in 10 minutes, over 1 hour later no sign so we asked to move rooms .
Got to hotel, disappointed in the incredibly small rooms, but location is great .
 Website also said rooms had been recently redecorated ,  guess they forgot our 2 rooms ,  kind of shabby .
 Asked next morning ,  still told we couldn't empty them ,  offered to pull up website on our laptop which still showed that fridges came with rooms but they didn't want to see it ,  they just wanted to say that there rooms never had fridges and didn't know why BW advertised that they did .
 It was actually two rooms, with a sofa bed, desk, coffee table, and television in the first room, and a bed, dresser, and television in a seperate room .
 They did switch rooms eventually and even the bellhop thought it smelled horrid in the room .
Small rooms, we could barely fit two adults and two children in the room .
 It is in a great location, the rooms are clean and comfortable and the managers wine hour is a welcome bonus .
 While this was an older hotel, it has been kept up well and the rooms were satisfactory .
 The rooms were great and the Service wonderful .
The rooms and building are quite nice ,  location is excellent .
The rooms were clean and well appointed ,  the maid staff were excellent .
My family stayed at the Tuscan Inn April 20, 25 in two connecting rooms .
 The reasonable price of the hotel allowed us to book 2 rooms, thus giving the 4 of us a bit more space and 2 bathrooms   .
 Nice clean rooms and a spaciousbathroom .
great rooms fantastic location and great service !
My husband and i stayed here for 2 nights in march, I was concermed by the number of comments regarding the size of the rooms ,  yes they are a little on the small size but as there was only 2 of us plus my toddler daughter we found them to be more than adequate and very family friendly particularly liked the lock on the mini bar fridge door which housed a seemlessly endless supply of candy !
 A warm welcome on arrival and a nice suite although the rooms were quite compact, however I understand this is common in Fishermans Wharf  .
Apart from that, the staff were very friendly and helpful, the rooms were nicely decorated, and the beds were very comfortable .
 the rooms are very clean and are charmingly appointed  the staff could not be friendlier, and they knock themselves out to make guests feel welcome .
 The hotel is an Italian mediterrean theme everywhere, entrance, lobby, garden courtyard, restaurant, and rooms .
 The staff were helpful and attentive, the rooms were quite spacious and the whole place looked as if it was cared for .
 We had rooms that opened onto the garden and they were quiet .
 the rooms are small but very nice .
 Not the best place to be with kids, , smallish rooms, overpriced restaurant   and no pool, but I would stay there again if it were only the 2 of us .
 Rooms were a bit small but very clean and nicely maintained .
 Took the advice of other past guests and asked for 4th floor rooms which were very quiet .
 The room was clean, warm and comfortable but don't expect a great view from any of the rooms .
 Rooms   were cosy but had everything you wanted inc .
 the wooden blinds don't keep the rooms dark enough once the sun rises, street noise was a bit loud I bought a set of ear plugs .
 The rooms on the outer perimeter do get some street noise, but that didn't keep us from sleeping well .
 The price prohibited booking 2 rooms, which we had done in Vegas and Anaheim .
 We glimpsed rooms containing 2 Queen beds and they seemed to have more space .
The rooms were tiny and still decorated in the 70s style .
 We have 4 children and we booked two adjoining rooms .
 I agree with other reviews that the rooms were on the smaller side, but we thought the hotel was great overall .
 Yes, the rooms were small for the money paid but the location was wonderful .
 The rooms are nice but small and ask for a room that faces the courtyard .
 The staff was friendly and helpful, the beds were comfortable, the rooms were clean, and the location was convenient .
 While some have commented that the rooms are small at the Tuscan, that was not an issue for us .
we were there to see the city, not hang out in our hotel rooms !
 Clean and well, appointed rooms were a bit smallish for a family of four,  , but as one previous reviewer indicated, we spent most of our time out and about .
The rooms are very clean, spacious and quiet   .
 The rooms are small but attractive .
 I reserved two rooms, one for my son and his girlfriend, and one for myself .
 More intimate, close personal attention from the staff and exceptionally clean rooms .
 The rooms are nicely appointed with an honor bar that is not outrageously priced .
 The price was great, the staff was awesome, and the rooms were clean .
 The hotel was of a good standard, big clean rooms, decent bathroom and the free wine reception in the evening was an added bonus .
The rooms are clean and comfortable although mine   could have been bigger .
 The rooms were a little smaller than what I was use to but I believe that is common in San Francisco .
 And value is key for the rooms and the service !
 The rooms are sometimes small, but when you're in San Francisco, you don't spend much time in it .
 The service is always great and the rooms very clean .
 Am sorry for those few noisey rooms that some folks got saddled with .
 The rooms are very clean and very well appointed .
