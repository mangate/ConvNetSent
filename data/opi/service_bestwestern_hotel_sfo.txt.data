 Both of us having worked in tourism for over 14 years were very disappointed at the level of service provided by this gentleman .
 The service was good, very friendly staff and we loved the free wine reception each night .
 Also, thanks to Ken the concierge for recommending Grand Limo service .
 The restaurant is not cheap but is very well patronised and the service is very good as is the food .
 Service was spotty  Front desk was marginally helpful .
 This tuscan, themed hotel was charming, clean   comfortable and the complimentary concierge service was so helpful .
Phenominal Service, great room, great location ,  couldn't have asked for more .
 It has some charms in decor, and all staff gave very good service to us .
 The rooms were clean and updated, the beds were comfortable, and the bellman service was fast and efficient .
 A highlight of our visit was the historic boats at the Hyde Street Pier , ,  a national Park Service site that costs only $5 .
 The service was quick and gracious checking in and out .
Great location service and value !
So to sum up if your looking for somewhere to lay your head after a long day then this is the place for you if your looking for something a bit special with good customer service avoid this place like the plague
I did not take advantage of the concierge service, but I saw many people were receiving great service from them .
Great value and service for the price !
Excellent Service ,  Great Location
 The staff and service were exceptional .
The concierge can give discounts for booking city tours and for some restaurants, although we tried Neptune's which was recommended to us and felt it was overpriced for the service and quality .
 I personally appreciated the free internet service in the hotel .
In addition, they advertise Limousine service to the financial district but when I inquired they announce they had stopped the service and I would need to take mass transportation .
As I checked out I expressed my disappointment there were no biscottis and transportation service and the check out clerk tells me they do have the service and I needed to make an appointment .
 All employee's that I mentioned have shown customer service skills that are above and beyond .
We had a discussion on the plane that it was such a shame that customer service was gone in so many companies these days .
The rooms were a decent size for a city hotel and were very clean and well serviced .
Wonderful service friendly people
seems service just isn't the way it used to be .
i'am 40 years old and its very disheartening that people have lost their pride of service and doing a good job .
We have stayed at The Tuscan Inn on our last 3 trips to San Francisco, and I really can't fault the service .
 The staff at this hotel make you feel so welcome and its service with a smile .
 All the staff go the extra mile to assist in anyway they can and the staff of the ajoining Cafe Pescatore are just as welcoming, with great service and the food is excellent .
 We ate at the Italian restaraunt located in the hotel and the food and service was outstanding .
 Never experienced the room service .
 Service was all good, albeit a bit stoic .
 Unfortunately we didn't get to dine in the hotel restaurant, but I'd say it would be good, if the after hours service is anything to go by !
 I'd highly recommend the Tuscan Inn based on location, cheerfulness of staff, aesthetics in the room and general overall service .
Excellent service great location good value
The staff at the front desk could not have been more helpful and whilst we did not avail his services, the concierge always seemed to be busy with guests giving info and advice .
 There was also a gentleman offering massage at this time and we met a few people who had enjoyed his services .
 The food and service were both excellent .
 This was probably not the best pick for us as we don't like tourist areas and Fishermans Wharf if one big tourist service .
 There are many public transportation options including the cable cars, the trolley line and bus service .
 The highlight of this hotel for us was the service offered by the staff, particularly the two concierges on duty while we were there .
 Their service was of the level and knowledge I would expect at at 5, star hotel .
 One day we had the do not disturb sign on the door before the maid had come so we could rest, and when we finally stepped out for about an hour, we changed the sign for maid service and everything was perfect when we returned !
Amenities ,  While this hotel isn't a luxury property, they have some nice touches like marble bathrooms, mini bar, room service and an evening wine reception every day   .
 At this point I asked to be put through to Best Western Customer Services and amazingly our room was changed to a king bed suite as per our reservation within the hour .
 They state that there is an obligatory service charge for tables of more than 6 .
 We dined as a party of 4 and were still hit with this and then the waitress failed to hand over $10 of change taking this as an additional service charge .
 We were very impressed with the service we received .
The concierge service is second to none .
Tuscan Inn has it all, exellant location,very close to public transport, very clean, impeccable, friendly service and a supermarket opposite .
We found a great breakfast place just around the corner in Taylor St, called Darren's Cafe, good prices with excellant food and service .
 Valet parking for $40 per night seems a bit steep,but at least the service was efficient and quick .
 very clean,well maintained,with efficient,if not overly friendly service .
The hotel makes a big thing of the coffee bisc service in the morning,and this is quite nice .
 I'd say that,as far as the evening   wine service is concerned,if you happen to be in the hotel,it's fine .
 Did not eat at the restaurant, but room service was great .
 Overall, the stay at The Tuscan Inn was great and would highly recommend due to the room service .
 There are other hotels in the area who do not offer room service .
The service in the hotel was really good .
 The restaurant in the hotel ,  Cafe Pescatore ,  does the breakfast run for room service, it was adequate but a little overpriced .
 Lunch and dinner room service is provided by North Beach Pizza, which deliveries many Italian specialties including pasta, entrees, salads, sandwiches and of course ,  pizza .
 However, there are countless restaurants of all sorts and price ranges within a 1, 4 block walk of this hotel, there is little reason to order room service .
 We did not use this service but thought it was nice that it was available if needed .
 We did not eat at the hotel restaurant, we chose to eat at the IHOP around the corner for breakfast and it was good food and service, and they are open 24 hours .
 Maid service was prompt and outstanding .
very good hotel ,  great location, concierge extremely helpful, decor is nice and the maid service was excellent   .
 The customer service was wonderful .
 The adjacent Cafe Pescatero was handy for breakfast but had some hiccups in service, but it was okay overall .
, provide service like high end hotels .
Will store your luggage in separate room on your check out day if you have late flight, want to spend more time,Oldest Italian restaurant in the country w in walking distance, back east service, integrity, etc .
 Split a fare w a private service i .
, we walked everywhere including up the hill to Coit Tower   then walked down just in time to attend 1300 service @ St .
 The staff was so friendly and helpful and the concierge service was very knowledgeable .
 A masseur was giving guests a massage at the same location, not sure if there was a charge involved for that service, as there was no information about that anywhere .
The hotel is conveniently located to the shopping centre across the road, and we made use of this to purchase our breakfast requirements, as we had not had great service from the adjoining cafe Pescatore for our evening meal and thought we would do our own thing each morning .
Housekeeping service was very inadequate, though .
and the service was just ok too .
 The whole trip was ruined by the guest service of the hotel .
 They say they pride themselves on being the best in guest service but I was not impressed at all .
The valet parking was overpriced, the service was terrible, and the coffe was cold .
service was extra good, very friendly and there is a great cafe across the street   which has the best breakfast in the world .
 The service was fine with the exception of check, in .
 From reading other reviews, it seems as though this hotel has significant lapses in service from time to time .
 Nevertheless, I did like this hotel,  the rooms, location, and most of the service and I would stay here again .
Nice place but service could be better
 Overall we had a nice stay but just had some minor service issues .
 When we finally found the church later, the service times she had given us were wrong, too .
 Speaking of parking, you're going to have to pay and it's going to have to be valet service, as there are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .
 The hotel is pretty much as you'd expect from the chain , nice clean rooms well serviced, and the staff were extremely helpful,  very pleasant to deal with .
 Service was poor and they got our order wrong, but they did correct it at no extra cost and the food was good .
Great service and friendly Front Desk .
 The Concierge service is excellent .
 Valet parking was $36 a day, but we're not complaining because other SF wharf hotels have charged us a similar fee even without the valet service .
 This hotel is truly a value for the mid, level traveler looking for excellent accomodations and the HIGHEST LEVEL OF SERVICE ANYWHERE !
 But the maid service was excellent, it was very clean and the bed was comfortable .
 The service from every staff member we encountered was delightful .
Great location service and beer .
The hotel room was average although the service was good .
In accordance with the Tuscan Inn’s Italian style theme a coffee tea biscotti service was open from 6am till 9am in the mornings .
 In the evenings from 5pm till 6pm a wine, beer and sparkling water service was available .
 Maid service was prompt, too .
 the service is poor, and for those used to staying in Kimpton hotels .
There is simply not the service, oriented feeling one is used to in this hotel group .
 It has everthing you need to have a great time in a great city,  location, good service, great food  , comfortable rooms and a complimentary happy hour .
 The cafe is comfortable and service was attentive and polite .
Room service at the hotel is limited :
 The rooms are small but very clean, charmingly decorated with a view of the little flowered courtyard, comfy beds, plenty of pillows   towels and smiling service .
 I really didn't get a chance to experience the staff's level of service but the rooms are small as is the bathroom .
 One other thing, I took my family to the eating establishment connected to this hotel and the service there was TERRIBLE !
 The concierge, in turn, told us to see the bellman, who said the shuttle did not run on weekends and he knew nothing about how to arrange the service .
 We ate there several times and never had a bad meal or poor service .
 While we were making these arrangements, the valet secured a shuttle service to get us to the airport on time .
 Found the food there to be quite nice, and our service was always prompt and efficient .
I planned a weekend getaway and thought because of the location and Hotel chain we would receive good service .
 The service was excellent, the room was terrific, the bed was incredibly comfortable and the hotel is centrally located to all the major attractions of San Francisco .
Very clean room, great location, wonderful service and dog friendly .
 The personalized service always stands out and if we have a problem, it is immediately remedied .
 WORST BW we've ever stayed in as far as service goes .
 We ate breakfast there one day and were appalled at the slow service, rude waitstaff, and overpriced breakfast food .
 I had breakfast and dinner a few times at the restaurant joined to the hotel, Cafe Pescatore, and thought the food and the service were both very good .
 The rooms were great and the Service wonderful .
 The only complaint I have is the Valet service .
 The front desk is the worst service I have had in years .
 And the hotel restaurant food and service was   awful .
great rooms fantastic location and great service !
 i would also urge other vistors to prebook Alacatraz with Blue and Gold Fleet direct on there website before they arrive in San Fran as you can pick up your tickets at the self service machine without the miles of queues !
 The food at the &quot Cafe&quot  is quite &quot hotel, like&quot  but the service makes up for it .
 friendly service was evident each day and the gentleman conceirge was patient and helpful .
 The valet guy was extremely helpful and very friendly but the check in guest services staff on the whole uninterested and unhelpful .
 The hotel restaurant was a bit over priced but good service and good quality .
Courteous, responsive service and a great location !
 The service was good, the wine service each evening was very nice   next to the fireplace, and the location was awesome !
 The service was friendly and helpful at the front desk, but the conciege that I dealt with was not very good .
 Excellent staff and service and the adjoining Italian restaurant was superb .
 A very cheerful staff and prompt service .
 Great people, service was terrefic, especially during this stressful time !
 Teaming this Hotel with the great food   service @ Cafe Pescatore, I would definitely choose this hotel again while in SF, an experience we won't ever forget .
 I was also disappointed that the hotel's &quot room service&quot  came from a nearby pizzeria, but the hotel still charged a fee on each delivery .
 Being that I worked as a front desk person at a Best Western for quite awhile I was on the lookout for good service and facilities .
 We asked her how to get back to the airport without having to pay the shuttle service $15 each .
 And value is key for the rooms and the service !
 The service is always great and the rooms very clean .
nette Lage aber durchschnittlicher Service !
